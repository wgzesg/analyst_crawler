Singapore Airlines  - F1 & MICE Events To Spur Travel Demand, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-08-22 ,"We expect SIA (SGX:C6L) to do very well in the coming quarters, due to the combination of rising capacity restoration, strong demand, high load factors and robust yields. For FY23F (1 Apr 2022 to 31 Mar 2023) as a whole, we think that the SIA group should be able to restore 74% of its pre-COVID-19 capacity, rising to at least 95% in FY24F or higher if China reopens its borders sooner."
Singapore Airlines  - F1 & MICE Events To Spur Travel Demand, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-08-22 ,"Competition has also been relatively muted so far, with airlines in Southeast Asia gradually ramping up capacity deployment and certain key competitors such as Cathay Pacific and the mainland Chinese airlines still held back by Hong Kong’s border controls."
Singapore Airlines  - F1 & MICE Events To Spur Travel Demand, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-08-22 ,"On the demand side, SIA expects the strong demand in 1QFY23 to continue until Dec 2022, based on the robust forward booking curve."
Singapore Airlines  - F1 & MICE Events To Spur Travel Demand, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-08-22 ,"In 1QFY23, SIA group achieved a passenger load factor (PLF) of 79%, with Jun 2022 PLF at 85.5%. The strength in demand continued into Jul 2022 with PLF at 87.4%, which is the second-highest PLF in SIA’s history. In light of this, our previous FY23F PLF assumption of 79% appears too conservative, and we now raise it to 83%, while we also raise PLF assumptions for FY24-25F from 79-80% previously to 82%."
Singapore Airlines  - F1 & MICE Events To Spur Travel Demand, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-08-22 ,"Anecdotally, Singapore is seeing strong inflows of foreign professionals, while the F1 race event scheduled for 30 Sep to 2 Oct this year could draw as many as 35k tourists, with hotel room rates already spiking. Separately, the line-up of MICE events in 2H22F could further boost inbound travel into Singapore. These include major international events, such as Food and Hotel Asia – Food & Beverage (5-8 Sep) and Food and Hotel Asia (25-28 Oct), with each expected by the Singapore Tourism Board to attract more than 30,000 physical attendees."
Singapore Airlines  - F1 & MICE Events To Spur Travel Demand, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-08-22 ,"Cargo yields are also likely to remain elevated, especially between Europe and North East Asia, due to the avoidance of Russian airspace."
Singapore Airlines  - F1 & MICE Events To Spur Travel Demand, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-08-22 ,"We have raised our 2022 year-end target price for SIA from S$5.89 to S$6.10, still based on an unchanged target P/B multiple of 0.95x (mean since 2011), applied to the end-FY23F adjusted BVPS. We are applying the P/B mean to derive our target price for SIA (and not any higher), as we have already reflected the strong near-term outlook into our earnings forecasts and book values for SIA. Our target price has been increased because we have raised our FY23-25F core net profit forecasts for SIA by 55-66%. We upgrade our call on SIA from Hold to ADD, as we expect SIA to surprise the market with very strong FY23F earnings. Our FY23F core net profit forecasts for SIA are 62% above Bloomberg consensus."
Singapore Airlines  - F1 & MICE Events To Spur Travel Demand, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-08-22 ,"Key downside risks include the potential for oil prices to surprise on the upside in the event of negative geopolitical developments, and more competition as and when other airlines are able to redeploy more of their fleet."

On the other hand, cargo flown revenue fell marginally by 1.5% q-o-q to S$1.1b, impacted by the lockdowns in China."
Singapore Airlines  - Net Income Back To Black, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2022-08-01 ,"Operating expenditure was more than doubled y-o-y to S$3.4b as both net fuel cost (more than tripled y-o-y due to higher fuel prices and flight activities) and non-fuel expenditure (+62.5% y-o-y) increased. Consequently, operating income and net income turned into profit of S$556.4m and S$370.4m respectively, above our expectations."
Singapore Airlines  - Net Income Back To Black, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2022-08-01 ,"SIA’s full-service carrier turned from an operating loss of S$152.6m in the same quarter last year to a profit of S$624.3m in 1QFY23 (~7x q-o-q), driven by improvement in traffic and capacity."
Singapore Airlines  - Net Income Back To Black, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2022-08-01 ,"Scoot, which is SIA’s low-cost carrier, remained in an operating loss of S$51.9m but narrowed by S$82.6m q-o-q as capacity recovery for Scoot’s key markets such as Southeast Asia was catching up."
Singapore Airlines  - Net Income Back To Black, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2022-08-01 ,"As of 1QFY23, SIA’s overall capacity increased by 18.5% q-o-q to 66.7% of its pre-pandemic levels (Passenger: 60.7%; Cargo: 77.0%). SIA plans to reinstate 68% of pre-COVID passenger capacity in 2QFY23 and 76% by 3QFY23."
Singapore Airlines  - Net Income Back To Black, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2022-08-01 ,SIA expects demand to remain strong with forward sales staying buoyant for S$5.84.
Singapore Airlines  - Net Income Back To Black, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2022-08-01 ,"While we expect a continued recovery in air travel in FY23, we believe a large proportion of the positive outlook has been priced in, with forward price-to-book ratio trading at 1.2x (~1.5 standard deviation above historical mean)."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,Singapore Airlines (SIA)’s 1QFY23 net profit of S$370m came in above expectations at 27% of our full-year forecast. 1QFY23 operating profit of S$556m was the second-highest quarterly profit in SIA’s history.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,"We raise our FY23 net profit forecast for SIA from S$1.35b previously to S$1.85b, a level not seen in the past decade. Note that this level of profitability should not be taken as the norm and SIA’s current valuation is stretched."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)’s 1QFY23 net profit of S$370m (4QFY22: S$210m loss) came in above expectations, at 27% of our FY23 full-year forecast but 96% of consensus’. The upbeat 1QFY23 earnings performance was mainly attributable to the steeper-than-expected pax volume recovery and strong pax yields, with their positive impact further amplified by SIA’s high operating leverage."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,"SIA also benefited from a favourable fuel hedge gain of S$202m (pre-tax) in 1QFY23. Excluding the fuel hedge gain, SIA’s 1QFY23 net profit was still a positive S$202m, vs the S$303m net loss a quarter ago."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,"Revenue rose 58% q-o-q, driven by the passenger business. Pax flown rose 119.3% q-o-q to S$2,676m in 1QFY23, driven by a 126.7% q-o-q growth in pax volume. Pax yield moderated slightly to 11.7 cents per passenger-km in 1QFY23 (4QFY22: 12.1 cents), but still at about 25-30% above pre-pandemic levels. Cargo-flown revenue fell 1.5% q-o-q to S$1,096m on weaker cargo loads (-3.6% q-o-q) due to lockdowns in China, but cargo yields stayed at an elevated level of 80 cents per tonne-km (+2.2% q-o-q), significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels of 28-33 cents."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,"Improving operating cash surplus and balance sheet strength. SIA's operating cash surplus rose to S$1.48b in 1QFY23 (4QFY22: S$502m). This helped strengthen SIA’s balance sheet. Even with all its Mandatory Convertible Bonds (MCBs) treated as debt, SIA’s net gearing would be near 50% as at end-1QFY23 by our estimate, down from 63% a quarter ago."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,"According to SIA, the group’s pax capacity is projected to increase to around 68% of pre-pandemic levels in 2QFY23 (1QFY23: 61%) and 76% by 3QFY23. In an earlier press release, the company guided to restore pax capacity to 81% by Dec 22, with a plan to expand/restore its Japan and India networks as well as to increase flight frequencies to Los Angeles and Paris."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,"Pax load factor already at pre-pandemic levels. Driven by the strong air travel demand, pax load factor has recovered to pre-pandemic levels, standing at 85.5% in Jun 22. We expect the pax load factor to stay upbeat through end-22, given that the next two quarters are seasonally strong (with holiday travel periods)."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,"Healthy forward sales indicating buoyant pax yields. According to management, SIA’s forward sales today is very close to pre-pandemic levels. Based on the forward sales, pax yields are holding up till the end of 2022. Management noted that the company has not seen aggressive price competition at this juncture as all airlines are focusing on their own profitability recovery amid the current high level of fuel prices and inflationary pressure."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,"Management believes cargo yields are likely to stay higher than pre-pandemic levels in the near-to medium-term as air cargo capacity remains tight on key trade lines, particularly between Europe and Asia, amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This would support the profitability of SIA’s cargo business in the near-to medium-term."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,We believe all the above factors are paving the way for SIA’s strong earnings momentum in the next two quarters. Our updated net profit projection of S$1.85b (previous: S$1.35b) is a record level not seen by SIA in the past decade.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,"FY23 net profit forecast includes a substantial fuel hedge gain of S$910m (pre-tax) by our estimate, due to its favourable fuel hedge position (SIA hedged 40% of its projected fuel consumption till Jun 23/1QFY24 at Brent crude oil price of US$60/bbl, vs the current Brent spot price of US$110/bbl)."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY23 result Beat Expectations; Exceptionally Strong Profit Expected In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-08-01 ,"…but this level of profitability should not be taken as the norm. After the exceptionally strong FY23, we expect SIA’s profitability to trend downwards in FY24-25, as:

its currently favourable fuel hedge position ends in 1Q24,
competition (other airlines adding/restoring capacity) drives pax yields down to more normalised levels, and
cargo yields would also gradually return to normalised levels as the supply chain issue gets resolved."

We expect SIA’s net profit to see two consecutive years of decline in FY24 (- 26% y-o-y) and FY25 (-30% y-o-y), before stablising at a more normalised level of net profit of S$963m in FY25."

Singapore Airlines  - Emerging Victoriously From The Pandemic, DBS Research , Paul YONG [CFA]  | Jason SUM , 2022-08-01 ,"Passenger revenue skyrocketed by 119.6% q-o-q and 743.0% y-o-y to S$2,674.1m on the back of solid passenger yields, increase in capacity and robust passenger load factors."
Singapore Airlines  - Emerging Victoriously From The Pandemic, DBS Research , Paul YONG [CFA]  | Jason SUM , 2022-08-01 ,"Cargo revenue dipped on q-o-q basis to S$1,096.m (-1.5% q-o-q, +25.2% y-o-y) as a slight improvement in cargo yields tempered softer cargo volumes."
Singapore Airlines  - Emerging Victoriously From The Pandemic, DBS Research , Paul YONG [CFA]  | Jason SUM , 2022-08-01 ,"Operating profit of S$556.4m in the quarter was the second highest in SIA’s history; the group recorded an operating cash surplus of S$1,480m in the first quarter."
Singapore Airlines  - Excellent 1Q23; All The Pieces Fall Into Place, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-07-29 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)’s 1QFY23 (1 Apr 2022 to 30 Jun 2022) core net profit of S$322m outperformed expectations as it made up 55% of our previous FY23F estimate and 96% of Bloomberg consensus. This was mainly due to the reopening of Singapore’s borders from 1 Apr 2022 catalysed a doubling of SQ’s RPK (revenue passenger kilometre) demand in 1Q23 from the immediately-preceding 4Q22, with PLF (passenger load factor) rising from 49% to 82.4%."
Singapore Airlines  - Excellent 1Q23; All The Pieces Fall Into Place, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-07-29 ,"The SIA group’s ASK (available seat kilometre) capacity rose from 4Q22’s 52% of the pre-pandemic base to 1Q23’s 66% and we forecast further recovery to 73% in 2Q23F and to 79% in 3Q23F, based on SIA’s guidance. These percentages are measured against the equivalent pre-pandemic quarter in CY19. A future reopening of China’s borders will likely fill in the remaining gap, in our view."
Singapore Airlines  - Excellent 1Q23; All The Pieces Fall Into Place, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-07-29 ,"For now, SIA expects travel demand to be robust through to the year-end holiday period, with forward sales buoyant for the next three months to Oct 2022F. This suggests that SIA’s strong 1Q23 performance will likely be repeated in upcoming quarters as SIA has promised to keep a tight rein on non-fuel operating costs."

Our reported BVPS forecasts treat the S$9,693m mandatory convertible bonds (MCB) as wholly equity, in line with the accounting treatment adopted by SIA."
Singapore Airlines  - Excellent 1Q23; All The Pieces Fall Into Place, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-07-29 ,"We are applying the P/BV mean to derive our target price for SIA because we think that the risks and rewards of owning the stock are now in balance – with strong near-term demand, high airfares and increased market shares across most regions potentially offsetting higher operating costs from pilot salary restoration and the spike in jet fuel prices."
Singapore Airlines  - Excellent 1Q23; All The Pieces Fall Into Place, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-07-29 ,"Downside risks include higher oil prices with SIA only 40% hedged until Jun 2023F and stronger competition as other airlines ramp up their capacity restoration; we have modelled this scenario in our FY24-25F forecasts, which reflect lower earnings."

Singapore Airlines 1QFY23 Results Preview  - Expecting A Profitable Quarter, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-07-14 ,"Driven by a strong pax volume recovery and strong airfares in recent months, Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) is likely to turn in a profit in 1QFY23. We deem the street’s current FY23 full-year net profit forecast of S$316m for SIA (vs our forecast of S$1.35b) conservative and due for positive surprises."

(See Earnings Calendar of SGX Listed Companies).
Singapore Airlines 1QFY23 Results Preview  - Expecting A Profitable Quarter, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-07-14 ,The upcoming business update is the first quarterly reporting after Singapore’s major border measure relaxations (effective from Apr 22) and we expect an overall positive tone from the company.
Singapore Airlines 1QFY23 Results Preview  - Expecting A Profitable Quarter, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-07-14 ,"As SIA is now in a turnaround situation whereby a slight variance in any of the underlying operating drivers (e.g. the speed/timing of workforce ramp-up, level of pax yields, etc) would result in significant fluctuations in profitability, we find it difficult to do a quarterly earnings estimate with good accuracy at this juncture."
Singapore Airlines 1QFY23 Results Preview  - Expecting A Profitable Quarter, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-07-14 ,"Our guided range of S$180m-350m is based on our best guesstimate, by referring to SIA’s reported net loss of S$210m in 4QFY22 and adjusting for the rise in passenger numbers (about +150% q-o-q in 1QFY23 by our estimate) and surge in airfares in the recent months."

Strong near-term momentum aside, we note that the full recovery of SIA hinges on the re-openings of Northeast Asian countries (which collectively formed 26% of Changi Airport’s passenger throughput in 2019), as they have been significantly lagging against the backdrop of global air travel open-up.

Japan and Taiwan are gradually opening up their borders but at a very cautious pace. 
Japan has reopened its borders to travellers on guided tours from 10 Jun 22, but remains closed to individual travellers. It is also limiting the number of overseas arrivals to a daily cap of 20,000, which accounts for about 14% of the country’s average daily overseas arrivals back in 2019.
Taiwan has also recently loosened its border controls, allowing entries by international travellers from 15 Jun 22. On-arrival tests and three-day quarantine (followed by a four-day self-initiated pandemic prevention) are required. Taiwan is currently capping the overseas arrivals at 40,000 per week, representing only about 7% of Taiwan’s average weekly overseas arrivals in 2019."

Fuelled by a widened crack spread, the increase in jet fuel price was even steeper, now standing at over US$180/bbl and matching the historical high last seen in 2008.

Singapore Aviation Stocks  - Recovery On Track But Outlook Not All Rosy; Interest Hikes Weigh On Valuations, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-06-21 ,SIA (SGX:C6L) – HOLD with unchanged target price of S$4.88.
Singapore Aviation Stocks  - Recovery On Track But Outlook Not All Rosy; Interest Hikes Weigh On Valuations, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-06-21 ,"As illustrated earlier, theoretically, SIA (SGX:C6L)’s fair value (if using DCF valuation) would be the most sensitive to interest rate hikes. However, we note the speculative sentiment towards SIA could be high in the near term and we do not rule out the possibility of SIA trading higher on positive sentiments triggered by the likely exceptionally strong earnings in the next two quarters. As such, we see SIA as a trading play and hence have applied the P/B valuation method which is more short-term based in nature and offers a better sense on SIA’s trading price relative to its historical trading range."
Singapore Aviation Stocks  - Recovery On Track But Outlook Not All Rosy; Interest Hikes Weigh On Valuations, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-06-21 ,"Our target price of S$4.88 is pegged to 1.12x FY23F P/B (we estimate SIA’s adjusted book value per share at S$4.36 at end-FY23), 2.0 standard deviation above its historical average of 0.96x during the pre-pandemic years."

Singapore Airlines  - Multiple Risks Cloud Strong Revenue Trend, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-06-13 ,"High rates of global inflation, from higher food and fuel prices, and higher global interest rates are eating into consumers’ spending power, and overseas discretionary leisure travel could suffer in the future. A global recession in the future is a rising possibility, and if consumer spending falls, air cargo demand may also decline. As SIA (SGX:C6L)’s competitors ramp up their capacity deployment in the future, SIA’s heightened market share could fall back down to 2019 averages. This may cause the current high airfares to moderate, even if jet fuel price levels remain elevated."
Singapore Airlines  - Multiple Risks Cloud Strong Revenue Trend, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-06-13 ,"While SIA is 40% hedged at Brent price of US$60/bbl until Jun 2023, Brent is already at US$125/bbl and SIA is exposed to the jet fuel crack spread, which has widened from US$2/bbl a year ago to US$38/bbl now."
Singapore Airlines  - Multiple Risks Cloud Strong Revenue Trend, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-06-13 ,"Our analysis suggests that SIA may be keen to redeem half of its S$9.7bn MCBs within the next 2-3 years, before their yields rise from 4% to 5% p.a., as it is holding too much cash, in our view, with a net debt position of only 8.5% as at 31 Mar 2022 vs 32% as at 31 Dec 2020 (prior to the pandemic). Redeeming part of the MCBs will reduce SIA’s shareholders’ equity and make SIA’s P/BV valuations look more expensive, which is another downside risk factor for investors to consider."
Singapore Airlines  - Multiple Risks Cloud Strong Revenue Trend, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-06-13 ,"We reiterate our HOLD call on SIA. Our target price for SIA is reduced to S$5.75, after cutting FY23-34F EPS forecasts for higher oil prices and applying a lower FY23F P/BV of 0.95x (mean since 2011). We previously used a higher P/BV multiple of 0.98x (+0.5 s.d.) but now adopt a lower multiple as inflation may hurt discretionary travel demand in future."

Singapore Airlines  - FY22 Results In Line; Emerging Strong In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-05-20 ,"SIA’s recently released Apr 22 operation data was stronger than our expectations. While the pace of recovery in pax capacity (at 57% of pre-pandemic level in Apr 22) was well-guided by SIA, the key surprise came from the magnitude of improvement in pax load factor (LF). The Apr 22 actual pax LF of 72.7% (+18.2ppt m-o-m) was already ahead of our FY23 full-year pax LF projection of 68.3%, pointing to a recovery trajectory that is steeper than we previously expected."
Singapore Airlines  - FY22 Results In Line; Emerging Strong In FY23, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-05-20 ,"The recent border measure relaxations in Singapore have unlocked significant pent-up demand for air travel. The immediate lift in demand for air tickets has outpaced the near-term ramp-up in seat supply, leading to generally higher air ticket prices than pre-pandemic days."

Singapore Airlines  - Risk-Reward Now In Balance: Downgrade To HOLD, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-05-19 ,"SIA (SGX:C6L) reported a core net loss of S$268m in 2HFY22 (Oct 2021 to Mar 2022), which is 44% narrower y-o-y and 69% narrower h-o-h, due to stronger cargo profits and lower share of associate losses, partly offset by lower deferred tax credits."
Singapore Airlines  - Risk-Reward Now In Balance: Downgrade To HOLD, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-05-19 ,"Our end-CY22F target price for SIA is raised to S$5.92, based on a target P/BV multiple of 0.98x (+0.5 standard deviation above the mean since 2011 of 0.92x), applied to the end-FY23F adjusted BVPS. Our previous target price was S$5.88, based on a target P/BV multiple of 1.06x (+1 standard deviation above the mean). We have reduced the target P/BV multiple after raising our earnings forecasts. Valuing SIA at a P/BV mean of 0.92x (since 2011) yields a fair value per share of S$5.56."
Singapore Airlines  - Risk-Reward Now In Balance: Downgrade To HOLD, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-05-19 ,"Upside risks include a faster-than-expected recovery in international passenger traffic and average ticket prices after 1 April 2022 as Singapore has opened up quarantine-free travel to fully-vaccinated travellers from around the world. Furthermore, airfreight markets remain strong given the still-choked container shipping logistics chain; China’s Shanghai region plans a release from COVID-19 lockdown from 1 June 2022F and this could stimulate air cargo volumes from the recent weakness in March and April."
Singapore Airlines  - Risk-Reward Now In Balance: Downgrade To HOLD, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-05-19 ,"Conversely, the significant oil price increases pose the largest downside risk. SIA is only 40% hedged at an average Brent strike price of US$60/bbl from Apr 2022 to Jun 2023F, beyond which SIA is unhedged. At the time of writing, Brent crude is trading at US$113/bbl and Singapore jet fuel at US$133/bbl, which are multi-year highs."
Singapore Airlines  - Ready To Conquer The Skies Again, DBS Research , Paul YONG [CFA]  | Jason SUM , 2022-05-17 ,"SIA (SGX:C6L) ’s international passenger traffic has been recovering at a faster clip than its peers since Singapore launched its first VTL in September 21. We expect this trend to persist and envisage the group’s passenger volumes hitting 70% and 96% of pre-pandemic levels in 4QFY23F (March 23) and 4QFY24F (March 24), respectively, supported by Singapore’s new Vaccinated Travel Framework and the synchronised reopening of borders in the region."
Singapore Airlines  - Ready To Conquer The Skies Again, DBS Research , Paul YONG [CFA]  | Jason SUM , 2022-05-17 ,Favourable supply-demand dynamics to underpin healthy passenger and cargo yields. Colossal pent-up travel demand and the gradual restoration of passenger capacity will support passenger yields.
Singapore Airlines  - Ready To Conquer The Skies Again, DBS Research , Paul YONG [CFA]  | Jason SUM , 2022-05-17 ,"Air cargo demand was recently hit by weak manufacturing growth/contraction and lockdowns in China. However, air freight rates should remain strong for the rest of 2022, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict adds further strain to an already stretched global supply chain. Looking further into 2023, air freight rates will likely trend down, as supply chain bottlenecks are resolved and the air cargo capacity crunch is alleviated with the return of belly-hold cargo capacity. Nonetheless, they should stay above pre-pandemic levels given fundamental changes accelerated by the pandemic, like the advent of e-commerce."
Singapore Airlines  - Ready To Conquer The Skies Again, DBS Research , Paul YONG [CFA]  | Jason SUM , 2022-05-17 ,"SIA is more insulated than its peers in an inflationary environment because of its fuel hedging position and cost transformation efforts. Singapore jet fuel prices surged dramatically in 2022 and are currently 60%-70% above pre-crisis levels at US$130-140 per bbl after peaking at US$150 per bbl in early May 2022. This is certainly problematic for airlines, given that jet fuel typically accounts for 20%-30% of total operating costs. On a positive note, SIA will be less impacted than most peers in the region, given a slight improvement in its fuel efficiency (younger fleet), and the airline has hedged about 40% of its projected jet fuel consumption in the short term."
Singapore Airlines  - Ready To Conquer The Skies Again, DBS Research , Paul YONG [CFA]  | Jason SUM , 2022-05-17 ,"Furthermore, we anticipate continued improvement in SIA’s ex-fuel unit costs, as passenger load factors rise, and the airline reaps the benefits of multiple cost initiatives under its new transformation programme. Initiatives include digitalisation to enhance business processes and the introduction of new technology to reduce manpower."
Singapore Airlines  - Ready To Conquer The Skies Again, DBS Research , Paul YONG [CFA]  | Jason SUM , 2022-05-17 ,"SIA’s valuation may be above its historical mean, but it is still cheaper than competitors in the region. The airline is currently priced at 1.1x FY23F P/BV, at around +0.5 standard deviation above its 10-year mean. We believe that its relatively promising recovery trajectory and medium-term outlook justify a multiple that is on par with its peers."
Singapore Airlines  - Ready To Conquer The Skies Again, DBS Research , Paul YONG [CFA]  | Jason SUM , 2022-05-17 ,"We are lifting our FY23/24F net profit estimates for SIA to S$500m/S$1,067m to reflect the above-mentioned positive developments. Additionally, we are raising our target price for SIA to S$6.20 as we roll forward and boost our P/BV peg to 1.3x FY23/24F adjusted book value (1.2x previously, which is +1.5 standard deviation above the stock’s 10-year mean P/BV), to factor SIA’s brighter recovery and medium-term growth outlook."
Singapore Airlines  - Ready To Conquer The Skies Again, DBS Research , Paul YONG [CFA]  | Jason SUM , 2022-05-17 ,"We treat the MCBs as debt instead of equity, as we see SIA redeeming the MCBs within 10 years, and deduct the accrued interest at end-FY23/24F."
Singapore Airlines  - Ready To Conquer The Skies Again, DBS Research , Paul YONG [CFA]  | Jason SUM , 2022-05-17 ,"SIA's share price performance has been lagging other aviation counters in 2022 year-to-date, but we believe that a re-rating is right around the corner as the airline returns into the black in FY23F, and greater clarity on its longer-term growth prospects."

Singapore Aviation Stocks  - A Potentially Steeper-Than-Expected Recovery Trajectory, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-04-25 ,"Mar 22 air traffic statistics at Changi Airport and operating data of Singapore Airlines (SIA) came in stronger than we have expected. While the paces of recovery in the flight activities and the passenger capacity reactivation were broadly in line, surprise mainly came from the passenger volume."
Singapore Aviation Stocks  - A Potentially Steeper-Than-Expected Recovery Trajectory, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-04-25 ,"Changi airport passenger volume rose 62.2% m-o-m to 1,140,000 in Mar 22, which stood 19.2% of the pre-COVID-19 (Jan 20) level. National carrier SIA saw its passenger load rising 61.2% m-o-m in Mar 22, on the back of a 15.7% m-o-m increase in passenger capacity (ASK) and a significant 15.4%pt m-o-m improvement in passenger load factor."
Singapore Aviation Stocks  - A Potentially Steeper-Than-Expected Recovery Trajectory, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-04-25 ,The substantial improvement in Mar 22 operating statistics has been achieved even before the anticipated positive impacts of Singapore’s recent round of border measure relaxations (effective from Apr 22 onwards) kicked in. This is a sign that reaffirms the strong pend-up demand of air travel and points to a potentially steeper-than-expected recovery trajectory for the Singapore aviation sector.
Singapore Aviation Stocks  - A Potentially Steeper-Than-Expected Recovery Trajectory, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-04-25 ,"Since 1 April, Singapore has scrapped the previous quota-based Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) arrangement and replaced it with a new Vaccinated Travel Framework (VTF) which allows fully-vaccinated travellers to enter Singapore free of quarantine and on-arrival tests.

Singapore Aviation Stocks  - A Potentially Steeper-Than-Expected Recovery Trajectory, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-04-25 ,"According to a press release by Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) on 18 April, air passenger traffic in Singapore has reached 31% of the pre- COVID-19 levels in the week ending 17 April; this is compared with 19.2% for the whole month of March by our estimate."
Singapore Aviation Stocks  - A Potentially Steeper-Than-Expected Recovery Trajectory, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-04-25 ,"CAAS also guided that Singapore is on track to achieve its goal to restore over 50% of pre-COVID-19 air travel passenger volume in 2022. In its most recent update, SIA guided that it would raise its passenger capacity to 61% of the pre-COVID-19 levels by May 22, compared with 51% in Mar 22."
Singapore Aviation Stocks  - A Potentially Steeper-Than-Expected Recovery Trajectory, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-04-25 ,"Given the strong showing of Mar 22 operating statistics of Changi Airport and SIA and considering the further easing of travel restrictions effective from Apr 22, we have raised our FY22-24 net profit forecasts for SIA (SGX:C6L), SATS (SGX:S58) and SIA Engineering (SGX:S59) upward, to reflect a potential steeper recovery trajectory."
Singapore Aviation Stocks  - A Potentially Steeper-Than-Expected Recovery Trajectory, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-04-25 ,"Despite the raised FY22-24 earnings projection for the three aviation plays, our forecasts beyond FY25 are lightly touched as the stronger-than-expected recovery in the near horizon does not necessarily lead to higher longer-term earnings potential."
Singapore Aviation Stocks  - A Potentially Steeper-Than-Expected Recovery Trajectory, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-04-25 ,"We are still looking at FY25 as the year for the sector to see a full recovery, as some major markets in Northeast Asia (particularly China) are expected to lag behind in the trend of global opening-up."

"Singapore Airlines  - Recovery On Track, MCB Redemption A Priority", UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"SIA’s bottom line is likely to see a substantial improvement in FY23, driven by the expected progressive travel recovery and helped by a significant fuel hedging gain."
"Singapore Airlines  - Recovery On Track, MCB Redemption A Priority", UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"While we are optimistic that SIA’s business is due for a full recovery by FY25, we note that its costly MCBs issued at the height of the pandemic have to be redeemed first before the earnings recovery can deliver meaningful value accretion to shareholders."

a progressive recovery in SIA’s passenger business, in line with Singapore’s push towards an economic reopening; and
a significant fuel hedging gain of over S$1b due to its 40% fuel hedge level throughout FY23 and the recent sharp rise in fuel prices (current Brent crude oil spot price at about US$119/bbl vs SIA’s average hedge cost at US$60/bbl)."

While this strategy will help SIA secure and grow its market share against competitors’ during the recovery, it also means that the recovery in SIA’s core operating profit would be more backend loaded (i.e. in FY24-25), as operating costs (capacity driven) would run relatively faster than pax revenue (pax volume driven) in the early phase of the recovery (i.e. FY23)."
"Singapore Airlines  - Recovery On Track, MCB Redemption A Priority", UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"We project SIA’s net profit to rebound to S$338m and S$728m in FY24 and FY25 respectively, forming 50% and 107% of the pre-pandemic (FY19) level."

Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,Singapore Aviation - Embarking On The Recovery Journey
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,The recovery of the Singapore aviation sector is well on track. The consensus among aviation experts indicates that the sector is likely to recover to the pre-COVID-19 level towards end-24 (FY25 for Singapore-listed players).
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"Among the three aviation plays under our coverage, SIA Engineering (SGX:S59) (BUY, Target Price: S$2.80) is our top pick to ride the recovery, followed by SATS (SGX:S58) (BUY, Target Price: S$4.65) and SIA (SGX:C6L) (HOLD, Target Price: S$4.80)."
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,We maintain MARKET WEIGHT on the Singapore aviation sector.
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"International Air Transport Association has forecasted global air travel passenger volume to recover to 103% of the pre-COVID-19 level by 2024, with APAC tracking slightly behind at 97% of the pre-COVID-19 level. Our conversations with the management of the three listed Singapore aviation companies (SIA (SGX:C6L), SATS (SGX:S58) and SIA Engineering (SGX:S59)) have revealed a similar timeline – the consensus is that the Singapore aviation sector is likely to fully recover by FY25."
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"Singapore has recently joined a number of its neighbouring countries in lifting most of the restrictions on international travel. From 1 Apr 22, fully vaccinated travellers from all origins can enter Singapore free of quarantine and on-arrival tests."
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,We deem the relaxation as a big positive development for Singapore aviation and expect it to help Singapore move closer towards its goal to restore the passenger volume at Changi Airport to at least 50% of the pre-COVID-19 level in 2022.
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"Due to airlines’ proactive capacity re-activation plans (SIA will re-activate a flight as long as the operation is cash-generative), we expect flight activities to recover relatively faster than passenger volume."
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"As such, revenue of businesses directly geared to flight activities, including SIA Engineering’s line maintenance services (about 50% of its pre-COVID-19 revenue) and SATS’s ground handling services (30%) should recover faster than revenue of businesses linked to relatively lagged passenger volume, such as SIA’s passenger flown revenue (80%) and SATS’s infight catering revenue (40%)."
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"To ensure it can stay afloat and fulfil its significant capital commitment, SIA issued S$9.7b of mandatory convertible bonds (MCB) at the height of the pandemic. However, these MCBs would turn out to be highly dilutive if they are held to maturity and get converted."
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"We believe MCBs have to be redeemed (and better early than late), before the earnings recovery can deliver meaningful value accretion to SIA’s shareholders. The impact of COVID-19 on SIA Engineering and SATS is largely transient (manifested by goodwill/PPE impairments, one-off in nature)."
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"We expect positive news flow on air traffic recovery and Singapore’s further opening up to keep sentiment towards the aviation sector buoyant in the medium term. However, we caution that SIA, the largest listed proxy to Singapore aviation, has had its valuation run beyond the justified level by traditional valuation metrics."
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,Catalysts and risks. Some general catalysts for the aviation sector include a faster-than-expected pace of global opening up and travel relaxation. Downside risks include possibly more infectious/fatal COVID-19 variants that disrupt the global opening up process or further escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war which may dampen travel sentiment.
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"Re-initiate coverage on SIA, SATS and SIA Engineering."
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"SIA Engineering is a BUY, with a target price of S$2.80 (FY23 DCF, WACC: 8.5%, terminal growth: 3.0%)."
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"SATS is also a BUY, with a target price of S$4.65 (FY23 DCF, WACC: 7.0%, terminal growth: 3.0%)."
Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"We recommend a HOLD on SIA with a target price of S$4.80 (FY25 DCF, WACC: 6.0%, terminal growth: 3.0%)."

Singapore Aviation  - Embarking On The Recovery Journey, UOB Kay Hian , Roy Chen  [CFA] , 2022-03-28 ,"SIA Engineering’s dividend outlook is further raised by its 77.6% shareholder SIA’s cash needs for MCB redemption (likely in early-FY25). As such, we do not rule out the possibility of a special payout by SIA Engineering by FY24."

Singapore Airlines  - No More VTL Caps; No More Quarantine, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-03-25 ,Singapore announced a major transition to the endemic stage by essentially opening up VTLs to the whole world and for all flights from 1 Apr 2022F.
Singapore Airlines  - No More VTL Caps; No More Quarantine, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-03-25 ,"The implementation of the Vaccinated Travel Framework (VTF) from 1 Apr is a major positive for SIA (SGX:C6L), mainly because of the removal of the VTL quota, which is an artificial limit on the number of quarantine-free travellers that Changi Airport can receive."
Singapore Airlines  - No More VTL Caps; No More Quarantine, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-03-25 ,"Our end-CY22F target price for SIA remains at S$5.88, still based on an unchanged target P/BV multiple of 1.06x (1 standard deviation above the mean since 2011 of 0.93x), applied to the end-FY23F adjusted BVPS."
Singapore Airlines  - No More VTL Caps; No More Quarantine, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-03-25 ,We use a P/BV that is above the mean to reflect our optimism over the meaningful reopening of international travel markets by mid-CY22F. Valuing SIA at a P/BV mean of 0.93x (since 2011) yields a fair value per share of S$5.16.
Singapore Airlines  - No More VTL Caps; No More Quarantine, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-03-25 ,Other potential rerating catalysts for SIA include possible near-term strength in cargo yields. See: Singapore Airlines - Near-term Cargo Yield Upside.

Singapore Airlines  - Near-term Cargo Yield Upside, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-03-17 ,"The Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 lockdowns in China will likely raise cargo yields in Mar 2022, after the seasonally-weak Lunar New Year period."
Singapore Airlines  - Near-term Cargo Yield Upside, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-03-17 ,"High oil prices from late-Feb onwards will not materially affect SIA’s 4QFY22F (Jan 2022 to Mar 2022) performance, as jet fuel is usually priced with a one-month lag."
Singapore Airlines  - Near-term Cargo Yield Upside, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-03-17 ,"Our forecasts for SIA's FY22 (Apr 2021 to Mar 2022) remain intact despite expensive fuel. Reiterate ADD call on SIA with an unchanged target price of S$5.88, still based on FY23F P/B of 1.06x (+1 standard deviation from the mean since 2011) on our adjusted BVPS (book value per share)."
Singapore Airlines  - Share Price Weakness – Chance To ADD?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-02-25 ,"SIA (SGX:C6L) delivered a core net profit of S$28m in 3QFY22 (Oct 2021 to Dec 2021), which is a large S$463m positive swing from the S$435m core net loss in the immediately-preceding 2QFY22. SIA's 9MFY22 core net loss of S$837m made up 65% of our full-year loss forecast, above expectations due to stronger-than-expected cargo profits."
Singapore Airlines  - Share Price Weakness – Chance To ADD?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-02-25 ,"We expect SIA to report core net losses once more in 4QFY22F, as we are past the year-end travel peak season and cargo demand weakened over the Lunar New Year in Feb."
Singapore Airlines  - Share Price Weakness – Chance To ADD?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-02-25 ,"Strong oil prices have dampened investor enthusiasm for SIA, but oil price strength may be transitory, and borders may reopen convincingly by mid-22F."

In December 2021, cargo demand in Revenue Freight Tonne Kilometres (RFTK) terms rose to 1.2% above the pre-pandemic December 2019 level, which was a feat achieved despite Available Freight Tonne Kilometres (AFTK) capacity still 24.1% below the pre-pandemic level."

Singapore Airlines  - Robust VTL & Cargo Demand To Benefit 3Q, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP [CFA]  , 2022-01-27 ,"The outlook for 4QFY22F is less robust, as the VTL quota was halved from 21 Jan 2022 onwards due to the Omicron outbreak. Also, spot jet fuel prices have rallied to US$98/bbl, against our FY23F assumption of US$82/bbl, and SIA hedged only 40% of its fuel needs for 15 months from 1QFY23F to 1QFY24F."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Look At Downside Risks, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-10-18 ,"SIA's share price leapt 9% in the two market days following Singapore’s announcement on 9 Oct that the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) scheme would be expanded from two to 11 countries in the coming month, i.e. Germany, Brunei, US, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, UK, and South Korea."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Look At Downside Risks, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-10-18 ,"Fully-vaccinated travellers, and their unvaccinated children below age 12, can travel between Singapore and these countries without quarantine in the foreign country or upon return to Singapore, subject to one pre-departure COVID-19 test and another on arrival. Departures from Singapore can be on any available flight, but return flights have to be on specially-designated VTL flights so that travellers can avoid the 7-day quarantine in Singapore."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Look At Downside Risks, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-10-18 ,"For now, the positive impact of the VTLs to the SIA group is limited, because Singapore caps the VTL arrivals to just 3,000 daily, which is to be shared between the SIA group and other carriers, like Lufthansa, that are also operating VTL flights. In our estimate, the potential VTL traffic is less than 2% of SIA group’s pre-COVID-19 passenger traffic."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Look At Downside Risks, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-10-18 ,"We also highlight that while the US and much of Europe is open to Singapore arrivals, many of SIA’s key regional travel markets, like Australia, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia, etc., are still closed to inbound Singapore visitors. Singapore also continues to bar short-term non-VTL arrivals from most countries, except from Greater China."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Look At Downside Risks, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-10-18 ,"Still, we view the VTLs as a positive development in the right direction, and we expect Singapore to open up VTLs to more countries in the near future, or perhaps scrap the VTL scheme entirely in favour of a broad reopening of its borders to fully-vaccinated travellers from all countries. We expect a flurry of good news in the next 3-6 months."

"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Have Vaccination, Can Travel", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-09-22 ,"The opening up of the transatlantic travel market is the most significant development for international air travel since the start of the pandemic. This will pave the way for improved connectivity to other destinations. However, much of Asia, including Australia, still operates under travel restrictions."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Have Vaccination, Can Travel", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-09-22 ,"In valuing Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L), we have factored in a traffic recovery and have pegged valuation at 1.15x FY22/23 average adjusted book value."

"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Have Vaccination, Can Travel", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-09-22 ,"SIA's share price rises by 3.5%, following an announcement that the US will open borders for vaccinated travellers from November. Transatlantic travel between the US and Europe is the key focus but foreign travellers from most other countries, including China, would be allowed. The move will also facilitate hub connectivity to other destinations in Asia. It will also lead to greater pressure on China, a key market for air travel, to ease travel restrictions. However, the general opinion is that China will be cautious in easing cross border travel ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics in Feb 22, due to imported COVID-19 infections."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Have Vaccination, Can Travel", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-09-22 ,"Still, the move is a clear boost for international travel and IATA terms this as “a key shift in managing the risks of COVID-19 from blanket considerations at the national level to assessment of individual risk”."

In 2020, online retail sales penetration in Australia jumped 3.3ppt to 12.6% which is structural in our view and did not reverse post-lockdown. Yields were compressed by 46bp, 57bp and 50bp y-o-y respectively to 4.25% in Sydney, 4.43% in Melbourne and 5.00% in Brisbane due to an abundance of liquidity competing to acquire tenanted logistics properties at prime locations."

UMS’s 2Q21 core net profit of S$14.6m (+26.3% y-o-y) brought 1H21 net profit of S$30.0m (+34.6% y-o-y) to 51% of our 2021 estimate.

Gross material margin remained relatively stable y-o-y at 51.7% (2Q20: 50.8%), but narrowed sequentially from 53.1% in 1Q21, primarily due to the consolidation of JEP (SGX:1J4), which became a subsidiary (71.4% stake from 40.7% previously) as at 30 Apr 21."

UMS has kept its interim dividend at S$0.01, and is undertaking a 1-for-4 bonus issue, which we think is a surprise. This is supported by strong net operating cashflow which almost doubled y-o-y from S$10.7m in 2Q20 to S$20.1m in 2Q21, while 1H21 grew 43% y-o-y to S$28.8m.

InnoTek’s new CEO and Non-Independent Director Lou Yiliang (who joined at end-15) had implemented several restructuring initiatives to boost profitability, including an incentive scheme which rewards employees based on units produced per day and production yield. As a result, InnoTek managed to turn from a net annual loss of S$16.3m in 2015 to decade-high annual net profits of S$20.2m/S$16.7m in 2018/19 respectively. Meanwhile, its gross margins have also increased from 6.5% in 2015 to 24.6% in 2020. As such, InnoTek has become more resilient during economic downturns due to the initiatives. The track record of its major shareholder, the Chandaria family which is involved in the founding of Venture Corp (SGX:V03), has been underappreciated by the market. Mr Neal Chandaria has been the Chairman since 2017 to date, which are InnoTek’s most profitable years."

While PATMI remained in the red this quarter, it narrowed from a loss of S$1.1b in 1QFY21 to a loss of S$409m, helped by recovery in air travel, a fuel hedging gain of S$13m, mark-to-market gains of S$72m on ineffective fuel hedges (vs. S$464m losses in the same period last year) and the absence of non-cash impairment charges relating to the liquidation of NokScoot."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 1QFY22 Net Loss Narrowed To S$409mil, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-08-02 ,SIA plans to reinstate 33% and ~50% of pre-COVID-19 capacity and city links respectively by Sep 2021.

SIA (SGX:C6L)’s top-line q-o-q growth was underpinned by a 21% q-o-q rise in cargo revenue offset some point in the future. SIA has raised S$8.7b in convertible bonds, with an effective 4-6% cost of funding, which would be highly dilutive to shareholders, upon maturity.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Lowest Quarterly EBIT Loss Since Pandemic, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-07-30 ,"SIA (SGX:C6L)’s core net loss of S$430m for 1QFY3/22 was sharply narrower than the S$1bn loss for 1QFY21, as cumulative ineffective fuel hedging losses of S$462m were transferred from balance sheet equity into the P&L during 1QFY21, to reflect the fact that SIA had over-hedged relative to its actual fuel requirements."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Lowest Quarterly EBIT Loss Since Pandemic, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-07-30 ,"By contrast, SIA benefitted from fuel hedging gains in 1QFY22 (S$13m), and mark-to-market gains on the fuel derivatives (S$72m), as spot Brent prices have rallied to above the derivatives’ strike prices. The group pax airlines also deployed much more ASK capacity in 1QFY22 vs the trough in 1QFY21. On a q-o-q basis, SIA reported narrower EBIT loss, as

the SQ and MI pax airlines combined saw slightly narrower core EBIT loss of S$502m in 1QFY22 vs 4QFY21’s S$517m loss;

Despite this achievement, SIA’s core net loss in 1QFY22 of S$430m was wider than the immediately preceding 4QFY21’s core net loss of S$321m, most likely due to higher interest expense, and/or lower deferred tax credits."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Lowest Quarterly EBIT Loss Since Pandemic, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-07-30 ,"Our target price for SIA is based on an unchanged target P/BV multiple of 1.06x (+1 standard deviation above the mean since 2011 of 0.93x), applied to the end-FY22F adjusted BVPS. We reduce our target price slightly. See report attached below for complete details on target price computation."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Lowest Quarterly EBIT Loss Since Pandemic, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-07-30 ,"We use a P/BV that is above the mean in order to reflect our cautious optimism that international travel markets will open more meaningfully by mid-CY22F, which may rerate SIA's share price."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"Recovery path remains uncertain, but SIA has the balance sheet to wait it out."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,Completion of S$6.2bn MCB issuance ensures the carrier has ample liquidity to position for an eventual recovery.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"SIA is already trading at 1.2x FY23 P/B, indicating its longer-term recovery prospects are priced in."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,Upgrade to HOLD with target price of S$4.90.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,S$6.2bn issuance 94.8% taken up by Temasek.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"SIA (SGX:C6L) completed its issuance of S$6.2bn in Mandatory Convertible Bonds (MCBs) on 24 June that was 94.8% taken up by Temasek (including ~ 55.4% of its pro-rata entitlement). The take-up rate by Temasek is comparable with the 1st tranche of ~ S$3.5bn of MCBs issued in June 2020, which saw Temasek take up ~ 95.9% of the issuance. In total, SIA has now S$9.7bn of MCBs issued."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,Liquidity and cash significantly bolstered.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"SIA reported a cash balance of ~S$7.8bn at the end of March 2021, and the MCB issuance will boost its pro-forma cash position to nearly S$14bn. Noting that the monthly cash burn for SIA has now moderated to S$100-150m per month, this strong cash position will not only help SIA navigate comfortably through the current COVID-19 crisis, but also help fund its on-going fleet renewal program to capture any market opportunities as and when international air travel does recover."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,No immediate dilution from MCBs but the price will eventually have to be paid.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"While there is no immediate dilution from these zero-coupon MCBs, the redemption price for the MCBs have been on the basis of a yield to call of 4% per annum for the first four years from the date of issuance (being June 2020), and 5% per annum for years 5 to 7 and 6% per annum for years 8 to 10. This means that the accrued annual interest cost for the S$9.7bn in the next 12 months would be ~ S$388m (~ S 13cts per share), and over S$400m in the subsequent 12 months. By year 10, the accrued interest cost for the MCBs would exceed S$7.1bn, if they are not redeemed by then."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,Dilution from conversion of all the MCBs would also be massive.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"If all the MCBs were allowed to convert at the end of year 10 (at the conversion price of S$4.84 per share), this would result in the issuance of ~ 3,479m shares, equivalent to 117% of the ordinary outstanding share capital of SIA or a more than doubling of the total number of shares in issue. This would also mean a more than four-fold increase in the total number of shares in issue compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic struck."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"Would be cheaper to redeem and refinance the MCBs beyond year 4 using straight debt and/or equity, if circumstances allow."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"Given the potential highly dilutive nature of the MCBs, we should expect that once international travel recovers more materially and the global pandemic situation has stabilized, that SIA would look to substantially redeem most or all of the MCBs, including potentially refinancing them using straight debt or even equity. These MCBs may be redeemed in part or in full, at SIA’s discretion, on every six-month anniversary of the issue date."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"SIA expected to report deeper net losses in FY22F, though we still project the airline to return into the black in FY23F."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"We now project SIA to post a net loss of S$1.2bn in FY22F, as compared to S$0.2bn previously. This largely stems from the epidemiological situation deteriorating beyond our initial expectations, dampening the prospects for the formation of travel corridors between Singapore and other countries, though this is tempered by a more robust than envisaged air cargo environment. However, our FY23F forecast remains largely unchanged, with SIA posting a modest net profit of S$0.3bn."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"We still anticipate a meaningful uplift in air travel activity in FY23F (2022), driven by sustained momentum on the vaccination front. Singapore and key markets for SIA like Europe and North America are anticipated to pass the herd immunity threshold ( > 75-80% of population vaccinated) by late 2021, while other important markets like China, North Asia and the Pacific are expected to inoculate a critical proportion of their population by mid-late 2022. Accordingly, our current estimates point to the group’s RPK climbing to 20% of pre-crisis levels in Mar-22, and 80% in Mar-23."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,Surge in crude oil prices will have limited near-term P&L impact; reversal of losses on hedges to bolster equity position.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"SIA is still in an overhedged position (close to or even above 100% in FY22F) with regards to its jet fuel consumption due to hedging contracts entered prior to the crisis. Thus, the airline will be relatively less impacted than most peers by the bull run in the crude oil market."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"Note that SIA had entered into various Brent hedges covering up to 55.6% of the group’s projected fuel consumption at US$57-62/bbl with maturities spanning to FY24/25. As per the airline’s latest sensitivity analysis, every US$1 increase in crude oil prices will translate into a S$119m increase in shareholder’s equity. Hence, we should see a significant write-back to its fair value reserves over the next two years on buoyant crude oil prices."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,Upgrade to HOLD based on 1.2x FY23 P/B.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Longer Term Recovery Priced In, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Jason SUM , 2021-07-28 ,"Our target price of S$4.90 is pegged to 1.2x (+1 standard deviation of 10-year mean) adjusted FY23F book value, assuming that 100% of the MCBs are redeemed and taking into account all accrued interest costs of the MCBs as at end FY23."

The global chip shortage situation brought about by rising consumer demand for electronic products and supply disruption has positively impacted UMS’ key client, chip-making equipment producer Applied Materials (AMAT US). Also, in the recent 2QFY21 earnings transcript released by AMAT in May 21, the semiconductor giant disclosed that customers, for the first time, provided capital spending guidance for multiple years ahead, which will be a leading indicator for demand sustainability. This augments our thesis that: the ongoing massive capex spending, and supercycle in the semiconductor industry, will bode well for UMS, lifting overall factory utilisation rates and revenue above the S$200m mark for the first time in 2021 (2010-20 average revenue was S$124m; ranging between S$110 and S$164m)."

For instance, TSMC expects to invest US$100b over the next three years in capital spending, of which a large portion would be channelled towards chip manufacturing equipment, which AMAT’s Endura platform falls under."

The anticipated uplift in utilisation rates from fulfilling wafer-transfer modules for AMAT’s Endura platform is expected to drive positive operating leverage for UMS. While there is no formal disclosure on factory utilisation rates, our channel checks suggest sequentially improving utilisation rates since 1Q20 and they continue to remain elevated. This has also been reflected in the q-o-q sales growth since 1Q20. Our current 2021 revenue estimate of S$205m implies a 24.7% y-o-y growth, translating to core net profit estimate of S$58.4m (+35.1% y-o-y)."

Hong Leong Asia has been listed in the SGX since 1998 and is part of Hong Leong Group conglomerate, one of the largest globalised corporations in Asia.

Its subsidiary, Tasek, is the fourth-largest cement producer in Malaysia.

InnoTek’s new CEO and non-independent director Lou Yiliang (who joined at end-15) had implemented several restructuring initiatives to boost profitability, including an incentive scheme which rewards employees based on units produced per day and production yield. As a result, InnoTek managed to turn from a net annual loss of S$16.3m in 2015 to decade-high annual net profits of S$20.2m/S$16.7m in 2018/19 respectively. Meanwhile, its gross margins have also increased from 6.5% in 2015 to 24.6% in 2020. As such, InnoTek has become more resilient during economic downturns due to the initiatives. The track record of its major shareholder, the Chandaria family which is involved in the founding of Venture Corp (SGX:V03), has been underappreciated by the market.

OCBC’s CET-1 CAR improved 0.3ppt q-o-q to 15.5% in 1Q21. OCBC estimated that maintaining dividend payout at 40-50% would be able to support growth in risk-weighted assets of 7-8% per year without impeding CET-1 CAR. Management emphasised that dividend policy must be progressive and sustainable. As such, we expect OCBC to gradually increase recurrent regular dividends. Having a high CET-1 CAR also helped OCBC weather unexpected economic shocks, which has been aptly demonstrated amid the COVID-19 pandemic."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 2021 Mandatory Convertible Bonds, Phillip Securities , Timothy Ang , 2021-06-05 , 6% yield to maturity not guaranteed.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 2021 Mandatory Convertible Bonds, Phillip Securities , Timothy Ang , 2021-06-05 ,"In the event that the MCBs are converted into shares on maturity, bondholders’ returns may be lower than the stipulated 6% annual yield if SIA's share price is below S$4.84."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 2021 Mandatory Convertible Bonds, Phillip Securities , Timothy Ang , 2021-06-05 ,The bond structure may not appeal to bondholders because of its zero coupon and unfixed yield to maturity.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 2021 Mandatory Convertible Bonds, Phillip Securities , Timothy Ang , 2021-06-05 ,"For equity investors looking for capital gains, however, the MCBs can be used as a leverage to SIA’s potential share-price recovery. Gains on the MCBs trading on the exchange may be magnified more than the share price of ordinary SIA shares, given the MCBs’ derivative nature and lower price. That said, SIA may choose to redeem the MCBs early at a fixed price."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,Singapore Airlines (SIA) - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,"Strong cargo demand from e-commerce, pharmaceuticals and electronics."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,Cash burn rate reduced to S$100-150m/month.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,Issuance of additional S$6.2b of MCBs.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)’s FY21 revenue fell 76.1% y-o-y to S$3.8b, dragged by weak passenger revenue (- 94.7% y-o-y), but partially offset by higher cargo revenue (+38.8% y-o-y). PATMI loss widened to S$4.3b as compared to a loss of S$212m in FY20 as the full impact of COVID-19 was only felt from 4QFY20."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,"On a h-o-h basis, PATMI loss narrowed by S$2.7b h-o-h, thanks to lower fuel hedging ineffectiveness, fair value gains on fuel derivatives due to higher Brent oil prices, and a gradual recovery in flown revenue."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,No dividend was declared by SIA for FY21 as compared to 8 S-cents in FY20 to conserve cash amid a challenging operating environment.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,"Passenger traffic shrank 97.9% y-o-y for all three airlines as international borders remain largely closed. As of Apr 2021, SIA resumed 24% of pre-COVID-19 capacity and aims to reinstate 32% and 49% of pre-COVID-19 capacity and city links respectively by Jul 2021."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,"SIA’s monthly cash burn has reduced from S$350m last year to ~S$100-150m, backed by strong cargo demand and increase in passenger capacity. Management expects the cash burn rate to remain around the current level if demand conditions stay similar. The Singapore government announced further tightening social distancing measures and border controls amid rising infection rates in the community and resurgence of COVID-19 in several countries. This is likely to weigh on SIA’s recovery trajectory, especially in 1QFY22, given its sole alliance on international travellers."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,"As the recovery trajectory remains uncertain amid a prolonged COVID-19, SIA announced the issuance of the second tranche of Mandatory Convertible Bonds to raise ~S$6.2b to further strengthen its liquidity position."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,"Recall that SIA raised a total of S$15.4b of liquidity since Apr 2020 and has S$2.1b of untapped committed lines of credit. The renounceable mandatory convertible bonds (Rights 2021 MCBs) will be offered on the basis of 209 Rights MCB for every 100 existing SIA shares at an issue price of S$1.00/Rights MCB, with an initial conversion price of S$4.84/share and zero coupon."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,"Similar to the first tranche of MCBs issued last year, Rights 2021 MCBs may be redeemable at the option of SIA in whole or in part every six-months of the issue date before the maturity date at 8 Jun 2030. Implied yield depends on the timing of the redemption i.e. first 4 years at 4% per annum, subsequent 3 years is 5% per annum and the subsequent 2 years is 6% per annum, compounded on a semi-annual basis. If MCBs are not redeemed earlier by SIA, investors will get S$169.797 on maturity date for every S$100 in principal amount of Rights 2021 MCBs."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,"SIA's share price is trading at forward P/B of 1.1x, ~2 standard deviation above its historical mean. Valuation looks demanding."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,We assume the MCBs as half debt and half equity as we assume SIA may redeem half of the MCBs before its maturity.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Tapping On Additional Mandatory Convertible Bonds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-05-21 ,"After adjustments, our fair value estimate for SIA decreases slightly from S$4.80 to S$4.75 based on P/B multiple of 0.90x. Post the issuance of Rights 2021 MCB, we expect SIA's FY22 net gearing to improve from 0.4x to 0.2x."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 2HFY21 Little To Cheer With Additional S$6.2b In MCB Issuance, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-05-21 ,"While SIA's earnings were within expectation, the issuance of the S$6.2b in MCB offers shareholders little to cheer, aside from buying the carrier time to ride out the crisis. Still, the MCB will eventually be dilutive given that it has a 6% semi-annual yield to call. The accrued interest on the MCB is also carried off-balance sheet but in valuing SIA, we have factored in dilution from the deemed conversion of the MCB, including accrued interest."

SGX:C6L) reported a lower h-o-h loss primarily due to a 33% h-o-h increase in revenue, S$350m in fuel hedging gains vs a S$563m charge in 1HFY21. SIA also recognised S$286m in impairment charges in 2HFY21 on surplus aircraft. Cargo revenue was also 18.5% higher in 2H vs 1H. Total impairment charges in FY21 amounted to S$1.73b on 45 surplus aircraft."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 2HFY21 Little To Cheer With Additional S$6.2b In MCB Issuance, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-05-21 ,"SIA generated an operating cash deficit of S$3.3b in FY21, mainly due to ticket refunds and payments to creditors. Excluding working capital changes, SIA was cash flow positive to the tune of S$131.7m, but this excludes lease payments of S$552m."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 2HFY21 Little To Cheer With Additional S$6.2b In MCB Issuance, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-05-21 ,"Total debt to equity fell from 1.27x to 0.9x. However, if S$3.5b in Mandatory Convertible Bonds (MCB) were excluded, SIA's debt-to-equity would amount to 115%."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 2HFY21 Little To Cheer With Additional S$6.2b In MCB Issuance, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-05-21 ,"Book value per SIA share (BVPS) stood at S$5.36, as at end FY21, however excluding S$3.5b in MCB, BVPS would amount to S$4.18."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 2HFY21 Little To Cheer With Additional S$6.2b In MCB Issuance, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-05-21 ,"24% of the MCB would be used for debt servicing, while the remainder would be used to fund opex and fixed costs. The renounceable zero-coupon MCB will be allocated on the basis of 209 MCB for every 100 existing shares,  but Temasek has given an undertaking to take up its share and all unsubscribed portions."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 2HFY21 Little To Cheer With Additional S$6.2b In MCB Issuance, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-05-21 ,"Priced at S$1.00, the initial conversion price is at $4.84, with a 6% annual yield to conversion, compounded on a semi-annual basis."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 2HFY21 Little To Cheer With Additional S$6.2b In MCB Issuance, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-05-21 ,"However, we expect the reduction in government grants could eventually lead to higher cash burn if borders do not open up."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 2HFY21 Little To Cheer With Additional S$6.2b In MCB Issuance, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-05-21 ,"In comparison, SIA’s group pax capacity in Apr 21 was 24% of the pre-pandemic level. While SIA expects the incremental bellyhold cargo on such flights to cover variable costs, losses could potentially rise if capacity is too aggressive and if cargo yields start to falter. 2HFY21’s cargo yield was 10% lower h-o-h."

In valuing SIA, we have treated the MCB as equity but factored in annual dilution from the accrued interest. If MCB, excluding accrued interest is excluded from shareholders’ equity, BVPS for FY22 would amount to S$3.92 while if included it would amount to $3.20."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Good Price To Buy For The Eventual Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-05-20 ,SIA group's FY21 core net loss was 19% wider than our forecast as we overestimated fuel derivative gains for 4QFY21 but was 40% narrower than consensus.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Good Price To Buy For The Eventual Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-05-20 ,We upgrade SIA from Hold to ADD as SIA's share price decline opens up a new opportunity to accumulate for the likely reopening of borders during CY22F.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Good Price To Buy For The Eventual Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-05-20 ,"Our target price for SIA is lowered to S$5.64 on a lower FY22F BVPS estimate, still based on a P/BV multiple of 1.06x (+1 standard deviation above mean since 2011)."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Good Price To Buy For The Eventual Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-05-20 ,"SIA (SGX:C6L) group reported a 2HFY21 (Oct 2020 to Mar 2021) core net loss of S$481m, higher than 2HFY20’s S$323m loss, as the full effect of the COVID-19 pandemic was felt only from Mar 2020."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Good Price To Buy For The Eventual Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-05-20 ,"The 2HFY21 loss would have been higher if not for the S$350m in MTM fuel derivative gains (3Q: S$151m, 4Q: S$199m), which compares favourably to 2HFY20’s MTM losses of S$710m."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Good Price To Buy For The Eventual Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-05-20 ,"Against the immediately-preceding half-year, 2HFY21’s loss narrowed by S$1.26bn (-72% h-o-h), with three-quarters of the variance explained by the swing from 1HFY21’s S$564m in MTM losses to 2HFY21’s S$350m in MTM gains. These MTM gains and losses arise from the fluctuation in Brent crude oil prices against the over-hedged fuel derivative position and higher oil prices in the past six months have helped to narrow SIA’s losses."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Good Price To Buy For The Eventual Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-05-20 ,"SIA group’s reported net loss was a staggering S$4.3bn in FY21 vs S$0.2bn loss in FY20, with S$2bn of the FY21 loss contributed by various exceptional items; the main chunk of S$1.7bn came from aircraft impairments (mostly booked in 1HFY21)."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Good Price To Buy For The Eventual Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-05-20 ,"Despite the losses, SIA group’s net MCBs will only convert into ordinary shares on its maturity date of 8 Jun 2030."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Good Price To Buy For The Eventual Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-05-20 ,SIA group operating cash burn appears to be heading in the right direction.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Good Price To Buy For The Eventual Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-05-20 ,"Our target price of S$5.64 for SIA is based on the MCBs can only be converted on one specific day, i.e. 8 June 2030, which is the maturity date of both tranches of MCBs; a conversion date that is nine years’ away is beyond the decision-making horizon of many investors, in our view."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Good Price To Buy For The Eventual Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-05-20 ,"Furthermore, ample access to cash from shareholders is an advantage for SIA groupin the current environment and something that many of its airline competitors struggle with. Hence, we reflect SIA’s privilege by not assuming the conversion of the MCBs when deriving our target price for the airline."

The SIA group disclosed yesterday that it expects to deploy 28% of its pre-COVID-19 passenger airline capacity by June 2021 and 32% by July 2021.

Hong Leong Asia (HLA) has been listed in the SGX since 1998 and is part of the Hong Leong Group conglomerate, one of the largest globalised corporations in Asia. Hong Leong Asia started as a building materials supplier before venturing into the diesel engine segment. Hong Leong Asia’s building materials unit is one of the largest integrated players in Singapore, providing ready-mix concrete and precast concrete elements for public housing construction. Its subsidiary, Tasek, is the fourth-largest cement producer in Malaysia. We expect the earnings of the building materials segment to grow by 55% y-o-y for 2021, driven by better sales volume as well as better ASPs for precast and ready-mix concrete as construction activity resumes."

It manufactures and sells engines for trucks, buses passenger vehicles, industrial equipment and agricultural applications. Despite major disruptions due to COVID-19, China Yuchai recorded a 14.4% y-o-y increase in the number of engine units, as a result of the growth in China’s agriculture segment. We expect the earnings of China Yuchai to grow by 17% y-o-y for 2021, as the growth momentum should continue in 2021 from greater buying activity in National VI(a) compliant diesel engines before its full implementation on 1 Jul 21. To tap on the EV market in the longer term, China Yuchai is developing alternative new energy solutions in new generation hybrid power, integrated electric bridge and fuel cell system."

In the outlook statement of InnoTek’s recent 2020 Annual Report dated 13 Apr 21, InnoTek highlighted that its China's Auto division is experiencing great change, with a clear shift towards electric vehicles (EV). InnoTek’s precision metal components division also serves EV manufacturers. However, as the industry evolves holistically towards charging stations and infrastructure support, InnoTek will seek to deepen its value proposition with existing customers and develop new ones. This means moving beyond single-part manufacturing to parts assembly.

Also, we highlight that in spite of the weaker ruble against the US dollar, Food Empire has managed to mitigate some of the adverse impact on the bottom line through ASP hikes and cost management. We are encouraged by Food Empire’s core earnings (ex foreign exchange) growth in 2020 at 14% y-o-y despite stringent lockdowns in 2Q20. We believe this is a testament to its strong brand equity in its core markets that has been developed over many years."

As 2Q21 beckons, there are still no signs of border re-openings or the formation of travel bubbles. Instead news flow centres around new variant of COVID-19 and even restrictions on SIA (SGX:C6L)’s flights to Hong Kong. We now believe that border openings would likely be pushed back into late-3Q21 at best and even then it will likely be gradual. Under such a scenario, could even tap into the additional S$6.2b in mandatory convertible bonds, a scenario which the market has not factored in. We have currently assumed that SIA’s pax traffic for FY22 would rebound by 1,100% and amount to 25% of pre-COVID-19 levels. There is downside risk to this estimate. For now, we continue to value SIA at S$4.47, or 1x FY22 & FY23’s average book value."

On 4 Dec 20, the Grab-SingTel (60:40) consortium secured a digital full banking licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. We view this positively as it will allow SingTel to stack new business segment to help drive future earnings growth and diversify away from its key mature telecoms assets. In the near term, we see little earnings impact and assume the venture will take 4-5 years to break even. In addition, an initial S$600m equity injection is manageable (raising FY21 net debt/EBITDA from 1.9x to 2x) as we expect SingTel to maintain its dividend mandate. We value the digital banking licence win at 4 cents (or 2% of market capitalisation). This is based on 1x paid-up capital, or a 30% discount to large banks’ mean P/B of 1.45x."

About 93% of UMS’s recent 2020 revenue (2019: 92%) came from Applied Materials (AMAT), the semiconductor industry’s largest maker of machinery used to manufacture chips. In its latest outlook, AMAT is seeing strong order demand for its semiconductor segment, up 50% y-o-y at the midpoint of its 2QFY21 as at 18 Feb 21, due to acceleration of the economy’s digital transformation.

China Sunsine Chemical (SGX:QES)’s 2H20 net profit rose 11% y-o-y to RMB136.4m, as revenue grew to RMB1,291m (+1%) mainly due to record sales volume of 93,556 tonnes (+9.6%), which helped offset the slip in ASPs (-9%) of rubber accelerators. The bottom line benefitted from the expansion of the gross profit margin to 27.8% (2H19: 22.9%, 1H20: 23.2%), as well as tight cost control measures. This brought 2020 net profit to RMB218.8m (-43.9%), 7% above our estimate. China Sunsine maintained its final dividend of S$0.01 per share."
"Singapore Stock Alpha Picks (April 2021)  - Adding UMS, Removing Frencken", UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2021-04-06 ,"Gaining from higher capacity and elevated ASPs. The good set of results was attributed to management’s perseverance with continued investments to expand capacity over the past few years, despite the downward trend in rubber accelerator prices. The move is now paying off, with market share for China Sunsine more entrenched, alongside rising demand for new vehicles in China. Furthermore, the ASP of rubber accelerators, the main earnings driver for Sunsine, has continued to gain ground, in tandem with aniline, the major feedstock for rubber accelerators, due to higher crude oil prices. The average price of aniline has risen an estimated 17% qtd as at 25 Feb 21 to RMB8,372/tonne, a 29% sequential increase over 4Q20’s average."

InnoTek’s new CEO and Non-Independent Director Lou Yiliang (who joined at end-15) had implemented several restructuring initiatives to boost profitability, including an incentive scheme which rewards employees based on units produced per day and production yield. As a result, InnoTek turned from a net annual loss of S$16.3m in 2015 to decade-high annual net profits of S$20.2m/S$16.7m in 2018/19 respectively. Meanwhile, gross margins also increased from 6.5% in 2015 to 24.6% in 2020. As such, InnoTek has become more resilient during economic downturns due to the initiatives. The track record of its major shareholder, the Chandaria family which is involved in the founding of Venture Corp (SGX:V03), has been underappreciated by the market.

Additionally, we highlight that in spite of the weaker ruble against the US dollar, the group has managed to mitigate some of the adverse impact on the bottom-line through ASP hikes and cost management. We are encouraged by Food Empire’s core earnings (ex foreign exchange) growth in 2020 at 14% y-o-y despite stringent lockdowns in 2Q20.

We now believe border openings would likely be pushed back to late-3Q21 at best and even then it will likely be gradual. Under such a scenario, SIA could even tap into the additional S$6.2b in mandatory convertible bonds, a scenario which the market has not factored in. We have assumed that SIA’s pax traffic for FY22 would rebound by 1,100% and amount to 25% of pre-COVID-19 levels. There is downside risk to this estimate.

Yangzijiang announced a 31-vessel order win worth US$1.74b after the market close on 5 Mar 21. As the majority of the orders this year are containerships, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding’s higher shipbuilding margins from 2020 will spill into 2021 and be a secular trend for the company going forward. In our estimates, about 75% of the US$1.74b order was attributable to the containerships."
"Singapore Stock Alpha Picks (April 2021)  - Adding UMS, Removing Frencken", UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2021-04-06 ,"Upgraded order-win expectations for 2021. After the US$1.74b order win, we upgraded our 2021 order-win expectation of Yangzijiang Shipbuilding from US$3b to US$4b. Our 2022 order-win expectation of US$3b is unchanged at present. After its IPO in 2007, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding announced record orders worth US$5b but it has not seen those levels in the past 13 years. As a result, the year-to-date order wins of US$3.04b are the highest since 2008, and we rate chances for Yangzijiang Shipbuilding to exceed these levels as reasonably high, in our view."

In addition, if we add its net cash position to the current portion of its debt investments of RMB13.6b as at end-20, this would equate to S$3.7b vs its current market capitalisation of S$5.0b. This implies that investors are paying less than 0.2x 2021 P/B for the company’s shipbuilding assets."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,"We downgrade Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) from Add to HOLD as the SIA's share price is merely 11% shy of its high of S$6.42 on 2 Jan 2020, just prior to the outbreak of COVID-19."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,"Our target price for SIA for is raised to S$6 as we raise our FY22F adjusted BVPS estimate by 9% on fuel derivative gains, and raise our P/BV multiple from 0.94x to 1.06x. "
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,"The latter historical P/BV multiple is +1 s.d. above the mean since 2011, vs the mean previously, to reflect investors’ willingness to pay for recovery plays."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,SIA's share price has rallied sharply in recent weeks due to optimism that the ongoing global COVID-19 vaccine rollouts will reopen international borders and restore global travel; the market appears to have ignored the slower-than-expected pace of vaccinations in the Europe Union and blood-clotting issues with the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,"SIA's share price also reacted positive to news on 14 Mar that Singapore and Australia are working to open an all-purpose travel bubble by Jul 2021, which may allow vaccinated individuals to travel without quarantine restrictions."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,"The other positive is the fact that Brent crude oil prices have rallied, particularly since OPEC+ decided on 4 Mar to substantially roll-over the Mar production cuts into Apr, and Saudi Arabia said that it will continue its voluntary 1 million barrel per day production cut for another month into Apr. While higher oil prices are usually negative for Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) under normal operating conditions, SIA had over-hedged its jet fuel requirements for FY21F and FY22F, hence SIA will book realised mark-to-market (MTM) profits in its 4QFY21F P&L from its fuel derivatives that mature in 4QFY21F, as the derivative strike prices of ~US$60/bbl are below the current Brent oil price of US$67-68/bbl."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,"For the not-yet-matured fuel derivatives for FY22-25F, we expect SIA to book mark-to-market (MTM) gains into its FY21F B/S reserves with respect to the actual hedges against its expected future jet fuel consumption, and MTM profits on its 4QFY21F P&L with respect to the over-hedged FY22F position. As a result of this, we raise our SIA's FY22F adjusted BVPS estimate by 9% to account for fuel derivative MTM gains, reflecting current forward average Brent prices of US$65/bbl for FY22F, US$61/bbl for FY23F, US$58/bbl for FY24F, and US$57/bbl for FY25F."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,"In addition to our 9% higher FY22F BVPS estimate, we have also increased our target FY22F P/BV from 0.94x (historical mean since 2011) to 1.06x (+1 s.d. above mean), to reflect investors’ willingness to pay for recovery plays. This takes our new target price to S$6, which is only 6.5% below the high of S$6.42 on 2 Jan 2020 (adjusted retrospectively for the May 2020 rights issue), prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. This reflects SIA’s strong financial position, underwritten by support from Temasek."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,"By comparison, Cathay Pacific is still trading 20% below its early-2020 level."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,"Upside risks include a potential quarterly profit for SIA in 4QFY21F due to MTM gains, very strong cargo demand in 4QFY21F due to the Lunar New Year rush, and likely meaningful reopening of borders from 3QFY22F."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,"However, beyond the MTM gains, the long road to full demand recovery may temper investors’ expectations and pose downside risks to SIA's share price."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,"Our target price of S$6 is based on a target P/BV multiple of 1.06x (+1 standard deviation above the mean since 2011), applied to the end-FY22F adjusted BVPS."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,"To derive our BVPS forecasts, we have assumed that SIA will raise a further S$6.2bn in mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs) in FY22F, in addition to the S$3.5bn of MCBs issued on 8 June 2020. Refer to Fig6 in report attached below for SIA's equity and debt capital raising exercises since the start of the COVID-19 global pandemic."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Time To Take Profit?, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-03-18 ,Our adjusted BVPS calculation treats half of the MCB as debt (although the accounting treatment sees it as wholly equity) because we have assumed that SIA will endeavour to redeem half of the MCBs before their 10-year maturity or will refinance them using other sources of debt. Refer to report attached below for details on target price computation.

Singapore Stock Alpha Picks (Mar 2021)  - Add Frencken & China Sunsine; Remove BRC Asia & First Resources, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2021-03-05 ,"Revenue slipped 2.3% y-o-y to S$328.1m, as a result of lower sales from the industrial automation (-38%) and medical (-8%) segments. The relatively more profitable semiconductor (+50.6%) segment drove the uplift in gross margin to 18.3% (2H19: 16.4%). Additionally, tight cost control measures contributed to the increase in net margin to 7.3% (2H19: 6.1%)."
Singapore Stock Alpha Picks (Mar 2021)  - Add Frencken & China Sunsine; Remove BRC Asia & First Resources, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2021-03-05 ,"Demand for semiconductor components remains strong. The semiconductor segment is estimated to contribute 35% of Frencken’s overall sales in 2021 (2019: 18%). This will mainly be driven by the huge demand stemming from the accelerating development of 5G technology, reflected in the record capex spending by major foundries TSMC and Samsung in 2020-21. Pricing environment for the components manufactured by Frencken is understood to be healthy, and indicative demand from clients outstrips production capacity."

China Sunsine’s 2H20 net profit rose 11% y-o-y to RMB136.4m, as revenue grew to RMB1,291m (+1%) mainly due to record sales volume of 93,556 tonnes (+9.6%), which helped offset the slip in ASPs (-9%) of rubber accelerators. Bottom-line benefitted from the expansion of gross profit margin to 27.8% (2H19: 22.9%, 1H20: 23.2%), as well as tight cost control measures. This brought 2020 net profit to RMB218.8m (-43.9%), 7% above our estimate. China Sunsine maintained its final dividend of S$0.01."
Singapore Stock Alpha Picks (Mar 2021)  - Add Frencken & China Sunsine; Remove BRC Asia & First Resources, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2021-03-05 ,"Gaining from higher capacity and elevated ASPs. The good set of results was attributed to management’s perseverance with continued investments to expand capacity over the past few years, despite the downward trend in rubber accelerator prices. The move is now paying off, with market share for China Sunsine more entrenched, alongside rising demand for new vehicles in China. Furthermore, ASP of rubber accelerators, the main earnings driver for China Sunsine, has continued to gain ground, in tandem with aniline, the major feedstock for rubber accelerators, due to higher crude oil prices. The average price of aniline has risen an estimated 17% qtd as at 25 Feb 21 to RMB8,372/tonne, a 29% sequential increase over 4Q20’s average."

InnoTek’s new CEO and Non-Independent Director Lou Yiliang (who joined at end-15) has implemented several restructuring initiatives to boost profitability, including an incentive scheme which rewards employees based on units produced per day and production yield. As a result, InnoTek turned around from a net annual loss of S$16.3m in 2015 to decade-high annual net profits of S$20.2m/S$16.7m in 2018/19 respectively. Meanwhile, gross margin rose from 6.5% in 2015 to 24.6% in 2020. Thus, InnoTek has become more resilient during economic downturns due to the initiatives. The track record of its major shareholder, the Chandaria family which is involved in the founding of Venture Corporation, has been underappreciated by the market. Mr Neal Chandaria has been the Chairman since 2017, which are InnoTek’s most profitable years."

Singapore Stock Alpha Picks (Mar 2021)  - Add Frencken & China Sunsine; Remove BRC Asia & First Resources, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2021-03-05 ,"2020 earnings growth amid COVID-19 pandemic reflects resilient product offering and strong brand equity. Given the low price, relatively inelastic and consumer-staple nature of its products, Food Empire is likely to be more resilient and sheltered from an economic slowdown, in our view. Additionally, we highlight that in spite of the weaker ruble against the US dollar, the group has managed to mitigate some of the adverse impact on bottom-line through ASP hikes and cost management. We are encouraged by Food Empire’s core earnings (ex foreign exchange) growth in 2020 at 14% y-o-y despite stringent lockdowns in 2Q20. We believe this is a testament to its strong brand equity in its core markets that has been developed over many years."

On 4 Dec 20, the Grab-SingTel (60:40) consortium secured a digital full banking (DFB) licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). We view this positively as it will allow SingTel to stack new business segment to help drive future earnings growth and diversify away from its key telco mature assets. In the near term, we see little earnings impact and assume the venture will take 4-5 years to breakeven. In addition, an initial S$600m equity injection is manageable (raising FY21 net debt/EBITDA from 1.9x to 2x) as we expect SingTel to maintain its dividend mandate.

Singapore 2021 Budget  - Looking Towards Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research Team , 2021-02-17 ,"Key highlights from his speech include:

S$11b towards continued COVID-19 relief. In the new COVID-19 “Resilience Package”, S$4.8b has been earmarked for public health and safe re-opening measures including the nationwide vaccination effort. Another S$5b will go towards continued support for firms and workers while the remaining S$1.2b will be allocated to specific sectors with the emphasis on sectors that are expected to continue to be badly affected by the pandemic.
Looking forward, the Budget has allocated S$24b for economic transformation over the next three years with the broad goals being:

development of a vibrant business community,
catalysing capital by extending risk-sharing arrangements with financial firms, and
redesigning jobs and creating job opportunities.
GST increase to be implemented sometime over 2022-25. DPM Heng stated that the GST increase must still happen “sometime during 2022 to 2025, and sooner rather than later” given the onerous spending that the Government has had to undertake in the past 12 months and in the following 12 months. He noted however that S$6b has been set aside as an ‘Assurance Package’ so that the effect of the GST increase will not be felt for 5-10 years, depending on household income.
Climate change and supporting the move to electric vehicles (EV). In a longer-term theme, Singapore has undertaken to support UN efforts on climate change. On a more practical front, the government disclosed various measures to promote the adoption of EVs including:

aggressively raising the targeted number of EV charging points to 60,000 by 2030 vs 28,000 in the prior plan, and
increasing the per litre duty on petrol.
In 2020, Singapore saw a budget deficit of S$64.9b (13.9% of GDP) and significantly higher than the forecast a year ago due to COVID-19. In 2021, the budget will remain expansionary, with total expenditure projected at S$11b and an overall budget deficit of S$11b or 2.2% of GDP."

Based on our estimate, the extension of JSS could help to reduce SATS’s staff costs by ~S$22m for FY22F (or about 2% of its opex). We have factored in staff costs to increase by 34% y-o-y in FY22F as government relief tapers.

Currently, this represents 4.3% of our total permanent placement projection (8,600) in FY21F. If HRnetGroup could capture 5% of this market (10,000 permanent placements), this could see our initial projections of core PATMI in FY21F increase from S$45.8m to S$55.3m (+20.8%), or a 23.2% growth from pre-COVID-19 levels (from our previous +2.0% estimate), assuming all other variables stay constant.

Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"In a clear sign that the government will continue to provide targeted support for sectors and companies which are still hard hit by the pandemic, the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) was extended. The current tranche will continue to cover wages up to March 2021 for most sectors."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"In the new budget, the JSS will be extended for sectors that continue to be hard hit, including aviation, aerospace and tourism by six months to Sep 2021. For retail, arts and culture, food services and built environment, JSS will be extended by three months to June 2021. The targeted support and extend cost relief for the aviation sector will cost S$870 million under the COVID-19 Resilience Package."

Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"The transformation of our workforce will continue and the government has set aside S$24b to be allocated over next 3 years to enable businesses to transform, and this will include creating opportunities and redesign jobs for Singaporeans to develop their skills, creativity and talents. As part of the transformation, a wide range of capital will be available to start-ups and high-growth enterprises. In addition, mature enterprises will be able to tap on fund to adopt new digital solutions and embrace new technologies."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"A S$900m Household Support Package will provide some support to all families, with lower-to middle-income families receiving more.

Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"To build a nation that has the fiscal and social reserves for continued stability and progress, several measures were announced. Petrol duties will be raised with immediate effect and road tax rebates will help to offset increased costs. The government has recently unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030. This aims to create a green, liveable and sustainable nation for Singaporeans. The five broad pillars of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 are City in Nature, Sustainable Living, Energy Reset, Green Economy and Resilient Future. The government also intends to enhance charging network and promote the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs), which we discuss more below in the following section. The petrol duty was also raised with immediate effect – the first time in six years."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,The government will also lead the effort to issue green bonds on select public infrastructure projects. It has already identified up to S$19b worth of public green projects.
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,The key sustainability highlight of the 2021 Budget Speech was a significant boost to efforts to accelerate the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Singapore.
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"Electric Vehicles are “the most promising clean-energy vehicle technology available today”, Mr Heng said."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"The key initiatives to encourage the shift to Electric Vehicles in Singapore are:
Increasing the number of EV charging points to 60,000 by 2030, more than double the earlier target of 28,000 announced last year. There are currently just 1,800 EV charging points islandwide, according to a 4 January 2021 statement by Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung.
Budgeting S$30 million over the next 5 years to support EV-related initiatives, including expanding EV charging infrastructure at private properties.
Narrowing the price difference between EVs and conventional vehicles powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) through adjustments to vehicle taxes and rebates, incentivising buyers to switch to EVs.
Further discouraging the use of ICE vehicles, by increasing petrol duty rates by 10-15 Singapore cents per litre, effective immediately, accompanied by some rebates to offset the higher costs."

Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"Mr Heng had set the policy direction in his Budget speech a year ago, saying then that the government’s vision was “to phase out ICE vehicles and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040”."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"We expect the latest policy measures to significantly boost the number and penetration of EVs in Singapore in the coming years. There are now just 1,430 fully electric vehicles – mainly private cars – or 0.15% of the total vehicle population of 953,340 at end-January, according to Land Transport Authority data. Of the 636,480 private cars in Singapore at end-January, just 1,270 or 0.2% are fully electric cars."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"In a clear sign that the government is preparing for a much greater penetration of EVs in Singapore in the coming years, Mr Ong had said in a statement last October that the initial target of 28,000 charging points would be insufficient, “if we assume EVs are one-third of all private cars by 2030”."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"The government will take the lead in mobilising capital to fuel Singapore's sustainability drive by issuing green bonds on select public infrastructure projects.

Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"Singapore’s carbon tax will be maintained at the current rate of S$5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions until 2023. The government will review the level and trajectory of the carbon tax post-2023, and announce the review outcome at next year’s Budget."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"The GST rate increase will not be introduced in 2021, but the government added that it will likely be introduced some time during 2022 to 2025, and sooner rather than later, subject to the economic outlook."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"All in, the measures that the Singapore government is taking would be a supportive factor for the domestic equity market, but key drivers are still the global COVID-19 trajectory and the impact from overseas markets, given Singapore’s small and open economy. We provide further details on certain sectors below from the Budget:"
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"Pre-budget, market watchers were expecting another round of property measures to cool down residential property prices, especially in view of the still weak economic outlook. As expected, there was no mention at the Budget 2021 announcement. However, we expect the local authorities to continue to closely monitor property prices in the coming months to watch out for signs of prices running ahead of market recovery."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"Meantime, the extension of the Jobs Support Scheme will help to provide continued support for sectors such as tourism, retail and food services, which would provide some positives for retail and hospitality REITs."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"The land transport sector was also flagged for additional support by Mr Heng. S$133m has been set aside to continue the earlier announced COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund. Recall that it was announced in December last year that drivers in the point-to-point (P2P) transport sector will get a higher amount of grants to offset vehicle rental fees. Eligible drivers will get S$600 per month from January to March, and S$450 per month from April to June. The COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund replaces the Special Relief Fund, through which P2P drivers have been receiving payouts since February last year."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"Such funds are important – indeed for ComfortDelGro (SGX:C52), its taxi operation has been the main drag in 2020, with operating loss of S$64.4m. The group’s taxi fleet stood at 9,444 taxis (~60% hybrid) as at Dec 2020, which was ~12% lower compared to Dec 2019. Current utilization level is around 95%."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"That said, the government also announced that there would be an increase in petrol duty from 16 Feb 2021. Petrol duty rates will be raised by S$0.15 per litre for premium petrol while the rate for intermediate petrol will be raised by S$0.10 Petrol duty was last increased in 2015 when the rates for premium grade petrol and intermediate grade petrol were increased by S$0.20 and S$0.15 per litre, respectively."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"To offset the impact, active taxi and private hire car drivers using petrol and petrol hybrid vehicles would obtain petrol duty rebates of S$360 over four months. This is on top of a 15% road tax rebate for one year for all taxis and private hire cars using petrol. Buses using petrol will receive a 100% one-year tax rebate."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"For the aviation sector, the JSS will be extended further by six months from Apr to Sep 2021 but at lower wage subsidies of 30% for wages paid from Apr to Jun and 10% for wages paid from Jul to Sep. This compares to the current 50% cash subsidies of the first S$4.6k of gross monthly wages paid to each local employee."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"Separately, the aviation sector will receive additional S$870m of support and extended cost relief measures such as rebates on landing and parking charges, and rental reliefs for airlines, ground handling companies and cargo agents as international air travel demand remains muted."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"According to International Air Transport Association (IATA)’s latest estimates, global passenger traffic measured by revenue passenger kilometres is not expected to return to pre-COVID-19 levels until 2024 at the earliest. As it takes time for global rollout of vaccines, we believe that the Singapore government is likely to take a measured and gradual approach to the re-opening of borders to prevent the risks of imported COVID-19."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"We view the extension of support measures to the aviation sector as a positive which is likely to benefit Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L), SATS (SGX:S58), SIA Engineering (SGX:S59) which benefitted from declines in their group expenditures over the past few quarters, thanks to government support schemes and cost-saving initiatives. Moreover, the government also aims to invest in on-arrival testing and biosafety systems to secure Singapore’s position as a key aviation hub. The upgraded capabilities to enable safe travel could further aid SIA’s recovery, in our view."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"Budget 2021 targets a more modest budget deficit of -2.2% of GDP this year (close to our economist’s expectation of a -2.5% deficit), taking on a more prudent stance following 2020’s budget deficit (13.9% of GDP, ~S$64.9bn) with an additional S$11 billion in stimulus announced. As widely expected, while support for the economy and jobs was extended, the measures in the latest budget were more targeted with continued assistance for the most impacted sectors. At the same time, the focus has also shifted towards medium term goals and sustainable fiscal priorities to enable the country to emerge stronger from the pandemic."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"Amongst the various initiatives announced in Budget 2021 which included a $900 million Household Support Package, the extension of the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) in a calibrated manner is reflective of policy makers’ improved confidence on the recovery trajectory of the broader economy. To date, the JSS has provided meaningful support for businesses and workers during the pandemic, with over S$25bn committed to the scheme and support for more than 155,000 employers for up to 17 months. Sectors such as financial services and precision engineering, which have been relatively more resilient, did not have their subsidies extended after December 2020."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"While the current tranche of JSS will cover wages for most remaining sectors up to March 2021, more support was offered to firms in select tier 1 and 2 sectors that continue to be heavily impacted by the pandemic. A S$24 billion plan was also announced to support firms and workers to re-skill and adapt to the new demands of a post-COVID-19 economy."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"Our house expects Singapore’s GDP growth to recover around 5% y-o-y this year, at the middle of the Ministry of Trade & Industry’s 4% to 6% GDP growth forecast for 2021. This follows the severe -5.4% y-o-y economic contraction in 2020 due to the pandemic, which marked the worst recession for Singapore since independence. For 2021, on the back of our more constructive macro forecasts, we have upgraded our view on the financials sector and expect an improving outlook for the Singapore banking sector, which should benefit from an ongoing recovery in economic activities and vaccines rollouts which target full population vaccination by 3Q21."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"Overall, we see Singapore banks as indirect beneficiaries of the continued policy support for the economy and labour market, which supports market confidence and reduces concerns over cliff effects for the more impacted sectors, which should in turn translate into lower downside risks for credit costs."
Singapore Budget 2021  - Stronger Together, OCBC Investment , OCBC Research Team , 2021-02-16 ,"The call to grow infrastructure investments and engagement within the ASEAN region looks aligned with Singapore banks’ regional growth plans over the medium term, and should be supportive of loans and fee income growth prospects over time. A key part of the budget speech was also spent on sustainability initiatives, the Singapore Green Plan 2030 (which includes a goal to develop Singapore into a hub of green finance and carbon services and plans by the government to issue new bonds up to S$90 billion to finance long term infrastructure projects"

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Capex Pushed Forward To Future Years, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-10 ,Potential re-rating catalysts include fuel derivative MTM gains in 4QFY21F that may enable SIA to deliver another narrow quarterly loss.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Capex Pushed Forward To Future Years, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-10 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) completed negotiations with Boeing on the restructuring of its aircraft orderbook, after negotiations with Airbus had been completed several months earlier, and announced the new orderbook and capex spending guidance yesterday. None of the orders had been cancelled outright, although the annual capex guidance over the next 3-4 years has been reduced, which indicates that the orderbook delivery profile will be stretched out over several more years than originally contracted."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Capex Pushed Forward To Future Years, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-10 ,"SIA's capex for the current financial year ending Mar 2021 (FY21F) has been reduced from S$5.3bn to S$3.1bn (-42%), and for FY22F from S$5.7bn to S$4bn (-30%), but capex for FY23F and FY24F have been cut by less than 10% each against the previous guidance given in May 2020."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Capex Pushed Forward To Future Years, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-10 ,"As at 9 Feb, SIA group’s aircraft orderbook stands at 142 planes, i.e. 15 x A350s, 15 x 787-10s, 5 x 787- 8/9s, 31 x 777-9s, 31 x 737 MAX 8s, 29 x A320neos, and 16 x A321neos (of which 10 will be delivered by aircraft lessors and six will be delivered by Airbus directly). The new plane-by-plane orderbook delivery profile has not been disclosed."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Capex Pushed Forward To Future Years, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-10 ,"The other notable change to the orderbook was that SIA’s orders for 14 x 787-10s were replaced by 11 x 777-9 orders. The 787-10s were intended for SIA mainline to serve regional and medium-haul (MH) destinations, while the 777-9s were intended to replace SIA mainline’s ageing 777-300ERs on long-haul (LH) flights."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Capex Pushed Forward To Future Years, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-10 ,"SIA has 27 x 777-300ERs, and orders for 31 x 777-9s; hence the 777-9s may not only fully replace the 777-300ERs, but also potentially replace a few of SIA’s 19 x A380s, of which several may be permanently retired. The 777-9s may also be used on MH missions on selected routes in between LH flights to improve aircraft utilisation."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Capex Pushed Forward To Future Years, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-10 ,"SIA retains orders for 15 x 787-10s post-restructuring, to replace the existing 8 x A330s and 5 x 777-300s on MH missions."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Capex Pushed Forward To Future Years, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-10 ,"We do not expect the market to respond significantly to SIA’s announcement yesterday, as most analysts, including ourselves, would have already factored in some degree of reduced capex spending, even though SIA had not officially announced any changes to its last formal guidance on 15 May 2020."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - S$4.4b In Capex Deferment Is A Key Positive, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-10 ,We have thus raised our fair value multiple for SIA to 1.0x FY22 and FY23’s average and derived a fair value of S$4.43.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - S$4.4b In Capex Deferment Is A Key Positive, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-10 ,Maintain HOLD. Suggested entry price: S$4.00.

The carrier has also coverted its order for 14 B787- 10 aircraft into 11 additional B777-9 aircraft. The latter has about 27% higher seating capacity and has slightly higher range."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - S$4.4b In Capex Deferment Is A Key Positive, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-10 ,"SIA also appears to have pushed back the B737-Max deliveries beyond FY25. With this revised capex guidance, capex commitment for the next four years would amount to S$16.9b vs S$19.1b previously."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - S$4.4b In Capex Deferment Is A Key Positive, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-10 ,"In our recent note, we highlighted that the decision to raise additional capital will be contingent upon the ability to defer deliveries. FY22’s and FY23’s collective capex is about S$3.7b lower than our prior estimate."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - S$4.4b In Capex Deferment Is A Key Positive, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-10 ,"On balance, we now believe that SIA will be less likely to exercise the additional mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs), or could potentially seek an extension of the July deadline to issue the additional MCBs."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - S$4.4b In Capex Deferment Is A Key Positive, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-10 ,SIA will also have the ability to tap into the sale and leaseback market for its unencumbered assets or sell and leaseback some of the new deliveries.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - S$4.4b In Capex Deferment Is A Key Positive, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-10 ,"Factoring in S$3.1b in capex (previous assumption: S$1.7b), we now estimate that SIA would still have an organic cash burn.

Singapore Airlines  - Gradual Recovery Ahead, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-02-08 ,Strong cargo performance.
Singapore Airlines  - Gradual Recovery Ahead, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-02-08 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) released 3QFY21 business updates which were above our expectations. 3QFY21 revenue fell 76.1% y-o-y to S$1.1b due to continued weakness in passenger flown revenue (-95.0% y-o-y), but partially offset by higher cargo and mail revenue (+42.4% y-o-y)."
Singapore Airlines  - Gradual Recovery Ahead, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-02-08 ,"While PATMI remained in loss this quarter, it narrowed from a record loss of S$2.3b in 2QFY21 to a loss of S$142m in 3QFY21, helped by a net gain of S$63m on fuel hedging and fuel derivatives, lower expenditure and tax credit."
Singapore Airlines  - Gradual Recovery Ahead, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-02-08 ,Passenger traffic shrank 97.6% y-o-y for all three airlines but improved 44.7% q-o-q on the back of a 90.8% increase in capacity for 3QFY21.
Singapore Airlines  - Gradual Recovery Ahead, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-02-08 ,"As of Dec 2020, SIA resumed 19% of pre-COVID-19 capacity and plans to reinstate 25% and 45% of pre-COVID-19 capacity and city links respectively by Apr 2021."
Singapore Airlines  - Gradual Recovery Ahead, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-02-08 ,"Cargo continued to outperform passenger business due to strong cargo demand, airfreight capacity crunch and increased frequencies of cargo-only passenger aircraft deployment. We expect air cargo to benefit from the recovery of global economy, e-commerce and shipment of vaccines in 2021."
Singapore Airlines  - Gradual Recovery Ahead, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-02-08 ,Cargo yield could further improve given continued capacity crunch as it needs time for passenger travel to restart and to restore belly capacity.
Singapore Airlines  - Gradual Recovery Ahead, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-02-08 ,"As of 31 Dec 2020, SIA’s cash stood stable at S$7.1b. SIA has increased its liquidity by ~S$12.7b in 9MFY21. Cash burn has reduced from S$300m per month in 2QFY21 to S$250m per month this quarter, with near-term target to be S$200m per month as operating environment improves."
Singapore Airlines  - Gradual Recovery Ahead, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-02-08 ,"Assuming a cash burn rate of S$200m per month, SIA’s current cash position will likely last the airline for ~3 years."
Singapore Airlines  - Gradual Recovery Ahead, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-02-08 ,"While we expect domestic travel to recover first, followed by regional, and international travel, SIA is poised to benefit from Singapore’s progressive re-opening and the roll-out of vaccines in 2021, in our view."
Singapore Airlines  - Gradual Recovery Ahead, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2021-02-08 ,"After adjustments, our fair value estimates for SIA increases from S$3.70 to S$4.80, based on P/B multiple of 0.87x."

Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,"While SIA’s 9MFY21 results were below the street’s estimates, it was above ours, and we are encouraged by the q-o-q improvement at operating and bottom-line, brought about by increased aircraft utilisation and firm yields."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,"We believe that SIA’s careful strategy of adding capacity should lead to lower losses, provided cargo demand and yields remain firm."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,We now value SIA at 0.9x two years’ average forward book value and derive a target price of S$4.00.

Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)'s 9MFY21 earnings amounted to 100% of the street’s full-year estimate but amounted to 85% of our estimated ful-year loss."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,"On a q-o-q basis, SIA registered a 32% increase in revenue due to higher aircraft utilisation and better yields, which led to a significant reduction in operating losses."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,"Core net loss is estimated at S$205m, which was significantly lower than 2QFY21’s estimated loss. However, a key variance was that SIA recognised S$350m in tax credit for the quarter and this was significantly higher than the S$295m recognised for the whole of 1HFY21."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,"Still, we estimate that SIA was about S$220m EBITDA positive for the quarter. Book value rose S$0.14 to S$5.28, presumably due to fair value gains recognised in reserves."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,"SIA reiterated plans to add capacity to 25% of pre-COVID-19 levels for 4QFY21 compared with 20% as at 3QFY21. While there are concerns about the potential of higher losses if load factors remain low, SIA indicated that the incremental bellyhold cargo could cover variable costs."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,We also believe that both pax and cargo yields are likely to remain elevated and this could aid operating cash flow to breakeven levels.
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,"SIA indicated that it will however make its decision by Apr 21. As at end-Dec 20, SIA has S$12.7b in liquid funds, S$1.4b higher q-o-q, but this was due to the issuance of S$850m in convertible bonds and another S$500m in 10- year notes."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,SIA also has another S$9.5b in Medium-Term Notes.
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,We reckon that SIA was EBITDA positive for the quarter and also believe that working capital changes might have been in SIA’s favour for the period as customers were extending the bookings. This would then suggest minimal outflow from ticket redemptions.
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,"Factoring in interest and lease payments, SIA however guided that it is still losing about S$250m per month and hopes to reduce cash burn to S$200m. A key uncertainty is whether SIA will exercise the remainder of S$6.2b in MCB. Given the existing credit lines, we assume that SIA would not need to do so, but this would really be dependent on ongoing discussions to defer aircraft deliveries."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,We lower our SIA's FY21 net loss forecast by S$130m after factoring in higher tax credits. We have however lowered our pax load factor assumptions for FY22 and now estimate losses for the year vs a profit of S$261m previously.
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2021-02-08 ,"For FY22, we estimate that pax traffic will amount to 24% of pre-COVID-19 levels."

Since Apr, Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)’s quarterly non-fuel operating costs, including depreciation of ~S$500m, have fluctuated in a tight range of S$1.2bn to S$1.3bn, implying monthly cash burn of between S$233m and S$277m, or an average of S$250m."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Another S$16bn Of Capital-Raising Headroom, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-05 ,"SIA stated that its target is to reduce the cash burn to S$200m per month, and the key to achieving its goal was to generate more revenue by gradually reinstating its capacity."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Another S$16bn Of Capital-Raising Headroom, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-05 ,"From flying 19% of its available seat kilometre (ASK) capacity in Dec, SIA targets to fly 25% by end-Apr."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Another S$16bn Of Capital-Raising Headroom, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-05 ,"Our question to SIA was whether flying at the current passenger load factors (PLF) of 10-15% was profitable. SIA’s response was that it was not only covering the variable costs of its flights, but also making a positive contribution to covering fixed costs, even at mid-teens percentage load factors, because SIA has been able to remarket the belly space that was not used for the storage of passenger baggage as revenue-generating cargo space."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Another S$16bn Of Capital-Raising Headroom, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-05 ,"SIA also expects that its PLFs will increase as its global network covers a greater number of cities, as that increases the options for passengers to link different city-pairs via Changi."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Another S$16bn Of Capital-Raising Headroom, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-05 ,"SIA also said that it stands to benefit from COVID-19 vaccine cargoes from this quarter onwards, and that it is well-positioned to take its share of cargoes headed to Asia and the Southwest Pacific given its cold-chain handling capabilities at Changi."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Another S$16bn Of Capital-Raising Headroom, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-05 ,"SIA has already raised S$13.3bn in equity and debt capital since the start of the pandemic, and is set to raise even more funding. Given the lengthy nature of the pandemic and the uncertainty of when global borders can be reopened, SIA appears to be partial towards issuing a further S$6.2bn of mandatory convertible bonds (MCB), on top of the S$3.5bn MCBs issued in Jun 2020; SIA will make its final decision in early-Apr as the MCBs cannot be issued later than 31 Jul."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Another S$16bn Of Capital-Raising Headroom, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-05 ,"In addition, SIA said that it has S$10bn of unencumbered aircraft assets, against which it has the option to raise new secured financing and/or sell and leaseback (SLB). After raising S$2bn in new financing collateralised against aircraft assets in 2020, SIA has the headroom to collateralise up to an additional S$2bn of its aircraft assets without breaching its negative pledge on its Medium Term Note (MTN) programme. As such, SIA is in advance negotiations to sell (and leaseback) its aircraft to lessors, of which the headroom is S$8bn. The MTN negative pledge does not restrict SIA from performing SLB transactions."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Another S$16bn Of Capital-Raising Headroom, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-05 ,"Our forecasts have incorporated the additional S$6.2bn MCB issue, which is treated as equity on the balance sheet; this is why we forecast SIA’s net gearing to be only 0.9% at end-FY22F."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Another S$16bn Of Capital-Raising Headroom, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-05 ,"Our target price of S$4.89 for SIA is based on an unchanged target P/BV multiple of 0.94x (mean since 2011), applied to the end-FY22F adjusted BVPS."

See details in report attached below."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Another S$16bn Of Capital-Raising Headroom, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2021-02-05 ,Our adjusted BVPS calculation treats half of the MCB as debt (although the accounting treatment sees it as wholly equity) because we have assumed that SIA will endeavour to redeem half of the MCBs before their 10-year maturity or will refinance them using other sources of debt.

The S$566m q-o-q narrowing of core net losses was mainly driven by

fuel derivative MTM (mark-to-market) gains in the 3Q of S$187m vs MTM losses in the 2Q of S$102m (S$289m q-o-q positive swing) due to an increase in spot Brent crude prices from US$41/bbl at end-Sep to US$51/bbl at end-Dec, and

With that, we have valued SIA on a pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 EV/EBITDA multiple. The enterprise value factors in:

On 4 Dec 20, the Grab-SingTel (60:40) consortium secured a digital full banking (DFB) licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

In the near term, we see little earnings impact and assume the venture will take 4-5 years to breakeven. In addition, an initial S$600m equity injection is manageable (raising FY21 net debt/EBITDA from 1.9x to 2x) as we expect SingTel to maintain its dividend mandate.

Yangzijiang Shipbuilding outperformed our expectations with US$1.8b worth of new orders in 2020 in the face of a tough year given the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yangzijiang Shipbuilding’s 4Q20 results should be strong given that the company’s new order wins peaked during the quarter at nearly US$1b. In addition, results may be bolstered by the potential of a tax write-back at the end of 2020 as its new shipyard may qualify as a “New High Tech Enterprise”, thus attracting a lower tax rate of 15% vs the current 25% tax rate that Yangzijiang Shipbuilding has provisioned for. This would equate to a tax write-back of around RMB100m which we have not factored into our current forecasts."

Yangzijiang Shipbuilding has outperformed our expectations with US$1.8b worth of new orders in 2020 in a tough year, given the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, the company appears to have expanded its market share in China, given that almost all of its orders in 2020 were from China clients compared to the past which saw a more even distribution of orders originating from clients in Europe, the US and Asia. We expect the company to build on this momentum in 2021 and conservatively forecast a similar level of order wins of US$1.8b. We also highlight commentary from management that global new ship-building orders declined by about 50% in 9M20 amid a depressed market, which makes the company’s order wins this year all the more compelling."
"Singapore Stock Alpha Picks  - Strong Outperformance In Dec 20; Add First Resources, Sunpower, Food Empire, Drop Nanofilm, Japfa", UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2021-01-08 ,"Expecting solid 4Q20 results. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding’s 4Q20 results should be strong, given that its new order wins peaked during the quarter at nearly US$1bn . In addition, results may be bolstered by the potential of a tax write-back at the end of 2020 as its new shipyard may qualify as a “New High Tech Enterprise”, thus attracting a lower tax rate of 15% vs the current 25% tax rate that Yangzijiang Shipbuilding has provisioned for. This would equate to a tax write-back of around RMB100m which we have not factored into our current forecasts."
"Singapore Stock Alpha Picks  - Strong Outperformance In Dec 20; Add First Resources, Sunpower, Food Empire, Drop Nanofilm, Japfa", UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2021-01-08 ,"We believe Yangzijiang Shipbuilding remains a compelling stock for this year as its valuations remain undemanding, with 2021 EV/EBITDA and P/B of 2.6x and 0.52x respectively, a PEG ratio of 0.69 and net cash of S$0.22/share (or 23% of its current share price). In addition, if we add its net cash to the current portion of its debt investments of RMB13.6b as at end-3Q20, this would be equivalent to its current market capitalisation of S$3.5b.

Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,"The roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines may boost Singapore Airlines’ cargo volumes, gradually restore pax travel and deliver fuel mark-to-market gains to the P&L and balance sheet."
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,"For these reasons, we cut our loss estimates and raise our Singapore Airlines target price to S$4.91 on P/BV of 0.94x (mean since 2011) against the end-FY22F adjusted BVPS."
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,Reiterate ADD as the positive newsflow momentum is just beginning.
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,"IATA estimated on 9 Sep that just delivering one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to 7.8bn people globally may require 8,000 747 freighters, or 975k doses per plane."
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,"We estimate that, globally, there are about 1,000 747-equivalent dedicated freighters, which must bear the burden of vaccine transportation given that passenger planes are still mostly parked."
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,"Delivering one vaccine dose to 20% of the world’s population by end-CY21 may provide the 1,000 747-equivalent freighters an extra 1.6 trips over the next 12 months, rising to 3.2 trips if two doses are required."
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,"It is important to remember that vaccine deliveries are in addition to all the usual cargoes carried by airfreight and come at a time when container spot shipping freight rates are at all-time highs. In other words, the airfreight of vaccines, which will likely begin from late-CY20 or early-CY21, could help bolster Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L)’s cargo volumes and support airfreight rates at higher levels for longer."
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,"Optimism about the potential for COVID-19 vaccines to restore demand for transportation fuels has pushed up Brent crude oil prices close to US$50/bbl from its Apr low of US$17/bbl and the 30 Sep close of US$41/bbl. Oil markets were also positive about the decision by OPEC+ to taper its crude oil output cuts by only 0.5 million barrels per day (mbpd), compared to the earlier target of 2 mbpd."
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,"Higher Brent crude oil prices will likely result in Singapore Airlines booking in MTM fuel derivative gains on its FY21-22F over-hedged position to its 3QFY21F P&L (Oct-Dec 2020), and MTM gains to its end-Dec 2020 B/S reserves for its effective fuel hedge positions up to FY25F. The potential MTM gains on the P&L will help Singapore Airlines deliver a narrower sequential core net loss during 2HFY21F compared to the 1HFY21 level as well as boost its book value per share, ceteris paribus."
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,"While higher spot fuel prices will cause Singapore Airlines to pay more for the fuel that it actually uses, the extra cost will be more than offset by the reduction in fuel derivative losses because Singapore Airlines is in an over-hedged position for FY21-22F."
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,"Previously, we had assumed that Singapore Airlines would deploy 45% of its pre-COVID-19 capacity in FY22F. In this report, we revise this down to 35% because Singapore Airlines disclosed recently that it expected to deploy 16% of its pre-COVID-19 passenger airline capacity by Dec 2020 and rising to 50% by Dec 2021, which averages 33% over CY21. However, we have not changed our already very-modest revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) demand assumptions, leading to higher load factor forecasts and reduced core net loss forecasts for the Singapore Airlines."
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,"Our target price of S$4.91 is based on an unchanged target P/BV multiple of 0.94x (mean since 2011), applied to the end-FY22F adjusted BVPS. See PDF report attached below for details on the SIA's target price derivation."
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,See SIA Share Price; SIA Target Price; SIA Analyst Reports; SIA Dividend History; SIA Announcements; SIA Latest News.
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,"To derive our BVPS forecasts, we have assumed that Singapore Airlines will raise a further S$6.2bn in mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs) in FY22F, in addition to the S$3.5bn of MCBs issued on 8 June 2020."
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,Our adjusted BVPS calculation treats half of the MCB as debt (although the accounting treatment sees it as wholly equity) because we have assumed that Singapore Airlines will endeavour to redeem half of the MCBs before their 10-year maturity or will refinance them using other sources of debt. See PDF report attached below for detailed assumptions used to derive SIA's target price.
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,Potential rerating catalysts include stronger-than-expected recovery in passenger traffic following a quick containment of the global COVID-19 pandemic once vaccines are available next year and higher-than-expected cost savings at the Singapore Airlines as a result of urgent efforts to contain costs.
Singapore Airlines  - Upside From Upcoming COVID-19 Vaccines, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-12-07 ,The Singapore Airlines disclosed recently that it expected to deploy 16% of its pre-COVID-19 passenger airline capacity by Dec 2020 and 50% by Dec 2021.

This led to significant selling by index funds during the week of 30 Nov 20; however, going forward, this overhang has been removed."
"Singapore Stock Alpha Picks (Dec 2020)  - Reshuffling After A Strong November; Drop DBS, Short SIA, Add Nanofilm", UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-12-07 ,"We highlight that Yangzijiang is in a strong financial position and has used this to good order by continuing to buy back its shares in the past few weeks. In the current share buy-back programme, it has purchased 48m shares or 1.2% of its total outstanding shares, and spending on average S$1m per day on the buyback. In our view, this is a strong signal of confidence from the company in its ability to continue to garner new order wins in the coming quarters."

"Singapore Stock Alpha Picks (Dec 2020)  - Reshuffling After A Strong November; Drop DBS, Short SIA, Add Nanofilm", UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-12-07 ,"We believe the development of the African Swine Fever (ASF) in Vietnam is somewhat similar to that in China, where the number of affected cases will peak in the first six months and then start to fall.

However, ASP has exceeded its 5-year high since late-3Q19. We believe this can be attributed to undersupply in the market due to a prolonged low ASP environment which has not incentivised the building of new dairy farms."

Singapore Airlines  - SIA Is More Expensive Now Than It Was 2 Years Ago. Downgrade to SELL., UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-12-04 ,"While the recent debt issuance would stave off operational risks, shareholder returns are likely to be severely crimped from higher interest payments as well as low ROIC.

Singapore Airlines  - SIA Is More Expensive Now Than It Was 2 Years Ago. Downgrade to SELL., UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-12-04 ,"We have also compared Singapore Airlines’s enterprise value to pre-COVID-19 FY20 EBITDA, which at 10.5x, is more than 2SD to the 5-year mean.

Singapore Airlines  - SIA Is More Expensive Now Than It Was 2 Years Ago. Downgrade to SELL., UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-12-04 ,"We believe that the euphoria of SIA share price following the announcement of vaccines is unjustified and opine that Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) is overvalued, even after the recent pullback."
Singapore Airlines  - SIA Is More Expensive Now Than It Was 2 Years Ago. Downgrade to SELL., UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-12-04 ,"For a start, we had already imputed a recovery in traffic for FY22 and had pegged fair value at 0.9x to FY22’s book value. While there is a great deal of uncertainty on the pace of traffic and load factor recovery, we believe pre-COVID-19 level FY20 EBITDA offers a fair hurdle in terms of earnings prospects for FY21. With that, we have valued Singapore Airlines on a pre-COVID-19 and post- COVID-19 EV/EBITDA multiple. The enterprise value factors in:

S$8.8b in rights and mandatory convertible bonds (MCB) issue;
new convertible debt of S$850m and exercise of S$500m from a S$10b medium-term note (MTN)."

Singapore Airlines  - SIA Is More Expensive Now Than It Was 2 Years Ago. Downgrade to SELL., UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-12-04 ,"Given Singapore Airlines’s massive fund raising, we believe EV/EBITDA multiple would provide a more incisive perspective on Singapore Airlines and have factored in S$3.5b in MCB along with capitalised coupons. Based on that, Singapore Airlines would be trading at a lofty 10.5x EV/EBITDA on historical EBITDA, which on a historical basis is more than 2SD to the 5-year mean, which is clearly is unjustifiable given the carrier’s massive recapitalisation."
Singapore Airlines  - SIA Is More Expensive Now Than It Was 2 Years Ago. Downgrade to SELL., UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-12-04 ,Even forward EV/EBITDA multiple at 11.0x is lofty and our net profit numbers are already higher than street estimates.
Singapore Airlines  - SIA Is More Expensive Now Than It Was 2 Years Ago. Downgrade to SELL., UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-12-04 ,"In assessing this, we used trailing FY20’s shareholder equity and added rights and MCB of S$8.8b and also adjusted for the theoretical conversion of MCB into shares. Based on that, Singapore Airlines’s trailing book value per share would be S$4.80."
Singapore Airlines  - SIA Is More Expensive Now Than It Was 2 Years Ago. Downgrade to SELL., UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-12-04 ,"However, if we factor in the asset impairment that Singapore Airlines announced in 1HFY20, book value per share would drop to S$4.43, bearing in mind that Singapore Airlines used to trade at P/B multiples of 0.8-0.9x even prior to COVID-19; a case can clearly be made that Singapore Airlines is overvalued even on a P/B basis."
Singapore Airlines  - SIA Is More Expensive Now Than It Was 2 Years Ago. Downgrade to SELL., UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-12-04 ,We believe that investors have not factored in the impact to Singapore Airlines’s earnings from additional funding.

"Singapore Stock Picks  - Go With The Flow, Don’t Fight The Market", CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-11-17 ,"We were previously prepared to rotate into cyclicals and beaten down sectors if a COVID-19 vaccine was widely available. However the musical chair of switching into these names were violent after the Pfizer vaccine news broke last week. Yield instrument (REITS) were generally used as a funding source into Capital Goods, Transport and Gaming."
"Singapore Stock Picks  - Go With The Flow, Don’t Fight The Market", CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-11-17 ,"We do not see a point in going against the market. The caveat is one has to look beyond two years for earnings normalisation as the real struggle against the COVID-19 virus is far from over. Critical mass deployment of any vaccine will take time and, in our view, clarity is only likely by mid-2021 globally, but the natural tendency among investors to look ahead will trigger the sustained shift into 2020-beaten down sectors."
"Singapore Stock Picks  - Go With The Flow, Don’t Fight The Market", CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-11-17 ,"Arguably, 2021 could be a better year than this one as our economist forecasts a GDP growth of 5.3% (2020: -5.7%), seeking reassurance from the recent discovery of COVID-19 vaccines that the trend of economic normalisation would start materialising next year."
"Singapore Stock Picks  - Go With The Flow, Don’t Fight The Market", CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-11-17 ,"We believe Singapore banks’ earnings recovery is sustainable in FY21F as credit costs likely peaked in 2020 with asset quality holding steady going forward. As book value risks dissipate, we expect improving ROE towards double-digits by FY23F to drive valuations back to historical mean of 1.3x."

Singapore Airlines  - Upgrading SIA To ADD On Improving Risk-Reward, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-16 ,"We now raise the P/BV multiple to 0.94x (mean since 2011) and now apply it against the FY22F BVPS to derive our new Target Price of S$4.57.

With over S$7bn in cash and bank balances, and an estimated cash burn rate of c.S$300m per month (excluding capex), the carrier is in a strong liquidity position to ride through the current crisis."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"SIA also announced the issuance of S$850m in convertible bonds, which will further help to boost its liquidity position. These convertible bonds bear at interest rate of 1.625% with an initial conversion price of S$5.743 for each new share, representing over 45% premium over the last traded price on 12 November. They have a maturity date of 5 years from 3 December 2020 and will be redeemed at 100% of their principal amount unless previously redeemed, converted, or purchased and cancelled"
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"Pfizer vaccine candidate’s interim results bring cheer to airlines. The aviation sector was uplifted in recent days by the announcement of the first interim results in large-scale trials showing the Pfizer/BioNTech candidate to be 90% effective, according to the manufacturers. The companies said they have so far found no serious safety concerns and expect to seek US authorisation this month for emergency use of the vaccine."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"The company says gathering required safety data will take until the third week of November, after which it will submit a dossier to regulators for approval. Speedy licensing could mean the first doses being given to healthcare workers by the end of the year."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"This news is significant in a few ways:

the potential 90% effectiveness of the two-dose vaccine (taken two weeks apart, and taking effect after a week) means that the virus might be brought under control sooner than some of the more pessimistic forecasts that stretch out to as far as 2025, and
other vaccine candidates could also find success soon and help produce more doses (Pfizer estimates that it could produce 50m doses or inoculate 25m people by end-2020, and up to 1.3bn doses (or 650m people) by end-2021."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"While this news does provide a clearer recovery path for international travel to resume sooner rather than later, we caution that there are still many challenges for any vaccine to be deployed globally, including

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"It is likely that developed markets will have access to any vaccine before emerging markets as well. Given the second wave of COVID-19 we are seeing in the US and Europe, it will still take time for the pandemic to be brought under control, even with a vaccine. In fact, we believe that the recovery trajectory is bound to be the slowest among all travel segments given that many governments are likely to remain highly cautious in reopening their borders to foreign visitors."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"We think the inflection point for SIA will be when major markets such as China, Japan or Australia open up their borders for unrestricted travel, or when the US or EU has controlled the pandemic well enough for other countries to open up their borders to them. Hence, the travel bubble arrangement between Singapore and Hong Kong will be closely watched for its level of success."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"A surge in oil price, especially if it is ahead of travel demand recovery, is also something to watch out for as it would crimp any margin recovery for airlines as and when demand rebounds. In the near term, however, a rebound in oil price is positive for carriers that have a large (ineffective) fuel hedging position such as SIA."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"We have assumed that SIA’s overall passenger traffic will gradually recover over the next 15-18 months to 80% of pre-COVID-19 levels by March 2022, or 67% of pre-COVID-19 levels by end-2021, as international borders start to open up and as COVID-19 comes under control steadily globally with the help of effective vaccines."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"We had previously assumed that traffic would nearly normalize by end 2021 but this has since been derailed by a resurgence of COVID-19 in Europe and the US, where daily new cases are reaching record highs."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"In contrast, we believe that SIA has assumed that capacity will be restored to 50% of pre-COVID-19 levels by end- 2021 for fuel hedging ineffectiveness calculations."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"We projected losses of S$4.5bn for SIA in FY21F and S$36m for FY22F, versus a previous forecast of a loss of S$2.2bn in FY21F and a profit of S$470m in FY22F."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Long But Visible Recovery Path, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-11-13 ,"Based on our new assumptions, we now project SIA to record annual revenues of S$4.2bn for FY21F and S$12bn for FY22F, an operating loss of S$2.1bn for FY21F, and an operating profit of S$222m for FY22F."

Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,"While headline losses were shocking, 80% of the losses were non-cash charges and SIA had operating cash burn of only S$255m in 1HFY21."
Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,"SIA’s guidance of higher capacity addition is also a sign of confidence.

Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,We are also optimistic of a recovery in cargo traffic and yields brought about by the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines.

Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,"Much of the cash burn was due to working capital changes of S$1.2b in ticket refunds and S$1.8b in payments to trade creditors, presumably the bulk was for payment for fuel hedges. Factoring in lease payments, operating cash burn would have been S$255m. SIA also spent S$893m on capex and S$114.6m on investment in associates."
Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,SIA is in negotiations with Boeing to defer capex and an agreement has been reached with Airbus but gave no details.
Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,SIA had previously guided for S$5.3b and S$5.7b in capex for FY21-22 respectively. We now assume that capex for FY21-22 would be halved from prior guidance.
Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,"The latter included S$2.3b in payments due to trade creditors and S$1.43b in debt due. To supplement its S$7b of cash and S$2.2b in credit lines, SIA is looking to sell and lease back 12 aircraft, which could ease its immediate funding woes."
Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,"SIA also highlighted that some of the S$800m in current forward bookings sales might not be redeemed over the next 12 months. We sense that SIA is looking to avoid the issuance of another S$6.2b in MCB. However, this would be largely dependent on the expanded border reopening and confidence in travel."
Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,"As at 1HFY21, pax flown revenue fell by S$6.7b for the group while cargo revenue rose 24% y-o-y to S$1.24b. While SIA is optimistic of continued strength in cargo traffic in the coming quarters, the carrier needs to grow its pax traffic to boost revenue. Naturally, this is contingent on border reopenings and the willingness to travel."
Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,"To that extent, SIA guided for group passenger capacity to rise from pre-COVID-19 levels of 10% as at Oct 20 to 16% by Dec 20 and noted pent-up demand for travel. However, the carrier indicated it will only add capacity if it can cover variable costs, which we would estimate would imply pax load factor of at least 40%."
Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,"SIA is doing all the right things to reduce cash burn and is also bolstering its liquidity. While the operating environment is highly uncertain, we believe the risks at this stage are equally weighted to the upside and downside, but any newsflow of an effective vaccine by this year-end would aid confidence in the stock. This would lead to advance bookings and boost SIA’s chances to raise funds."
Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,"We believe the SIA brand still commands tremendous brand loyalty, which could lead to strong pricing power when demand eventually returns. As such, we maintain BUY but with the caveat that effective vaccines are manufactured by this year-end."
Singapore Airlines 1HFY21  - The Long Wait For A Vaccine, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-11-10 ,We have also assumed SIA would issue S$6.2b in MCB by Mar 21.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Near-Term Positives For The Next 6 Months, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-10 ,"The most interesting disclosure was that the SIA group expects to deploy 16% of its pre-COVID-19 passenger airline capacity by Dec 2020, rising to only 50% by Dec 2021.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Near-Term Positives For The Next 6 Months, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-10 ,"First, SIA’s conservatism means that it is less likely to transfer accumulated unrealised mark-to-market (MTM) fuel derivative losses from the balance sheet to the P&L, on account of the derivatives being in excess of SIA’s actual fuel requirements, and hence no longer qualifying as effective fuel hedges. This is a positive for the future earnings announcements."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Near-Term Positives For The Next 6 Months, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-10 ,"On the other hand, if SIA is correct in its capacity recovery assumptions, our earnings estimates for FY22F (and possibly beyond) may have to be revised lower, which is a negative outcome. For now, we have kept our assumptions unchanged as the situation is still developing and a COVID-19 vaccine, once available, may be able to change the realities for the aviation industry slowly, but surely."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Near-Term Positives For The Next 6 Months, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-10 ,"The Singapore-Hong Kong travel bubble is expected to start sometime this month, and we expect the demand to be reasonably good, albeit likely still lower than pre-COVID-19, as travellers will need to pay for COVID-19 tests (making short trips expensive) and because the travel bubble will largely cater for origin-and-destination travel, with transfer traffic likely to stay modest."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Near-Term Positives For The Next 6 Months, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-10 ,"SIA will also enjoy the normal year-end cargo boom, and it will be better-placed to capitalise on it, as from this week, it will deploy two 777-300ERs (without seats) on cargo-only flights (1-year payback to recover the retrofit cost)."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Near-Term Positives For The Next 6 Months, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-10 ,"SIA group’s cash burn has reduced from S$350m/month in 1QFY21 to S$300m/month in 2QFY21, with its end-Sep cash pile of S$7bn able to last 24 months.

SIA also has access to S$6.2bn in Mandatory Convertible Bonds which it must issue by 31 Jul 2021 if it so chooses (SIA to decide by Mar 2021)."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Near-Term Positives For The Next 6 Months, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-10 ,"Our target price of S$3.46 for SIA is based on an unchanged P/BV of 0.75x (pegged to - 1 standard deviation from the mean since 2011). SIA's share price is currently trading at -2 s.d. from the mean but we think that this is too onerous for SIA as we have rolled forward our valuation basis to the adjusted end-FY23F BVPS of S$4.62 in order to capture as much of the expected losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic as possible. Once a global aviation recovery becomes more certain, the market may be more comfortable with higher P/BV multiples."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Near-Term Positives For The Next 6 Months, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-10 ,"To derive our BVPS forecasts, we have assumed that SIA will raise a further S$6.2bn in mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs) in FY22F, in addition to the S$3.5bn of MCBs issued on 8 June 2020.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Near-Term Positives For The Next 6 Months, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-10 ,Our adjusted BVPS calculation treats half of the MCB as debt (although the accounting treatment sees it as wholly equity) because we have assumed that SIA will endeavour to redeem half of the MCBs before their 10-year maturity or will refinance them using other sources of debt.

Singapore Airlines  - SIA’s Worst Quarter May Be Behind It, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-09 ,"The reported 1Q net loss included S$127m in aircraft impairments and provision for closure costs of NokScoot but the reported 2Q net loss included substantially more exceptional items, including S$1.33bn in aircraft impairments, S$170m in goodwill write-off, S$42m in headcount rationalisation costs, S$35m impairment of SIA Engineering (SGX:S59)’s base maintenance assets, etc. After stripping these out, SIA’s core net loss amounted to S$719m in the 2Q, which narrowed from 1Q’s S$1bn loss; the q-o-q improvement was mainly due to a lower value of MTM losses on ineffective fuel hedges transferred from the balance sheet to the P&L."
Singapore Airlines  - SIA’s Worst Quarter May Be Behind It, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-09 ,"In the 1Q, SIA transferred S$464m of fuel derivative losses into the P&L in relation to derivatives that were expected to be in excess of SIA group’s actual fuel requirements in FY22F; in the 2Q, only S$100m in fuel derivative losses were similarly debited into the P&L. This helped sequentially reduce SIA's core EBIT losses at the three passenger airlines."

Singapore Airlines  - SIA’s Worst Quarter May Be Behind It, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-09 ,All three passenger airlines managed to reduce their quarterly core EBIT losses in the 2Q from the 1Q. SIA mainline carrier (including the cargo operations) saw its 2Q core EBIT loss narrow to S$593m from 1Q’s S$667m. SilkAir’s core EBIT loss reduced to S$63m in the 2Q from 1Q’s S$102m while Scott’s 2Q core EBIT loss narrowed to S$142m from 1Q’s S$259m.
Singapore Airlines  - SIA’s Worst Quarter May Be Behind It, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-09 ,"As airline revenues did not change materially q-o-q and the airlines’ capacity remained severely curtailed, the improved EBIT performance came largely from the reduced MTM losses as explained above."
Singapore Airlines  - SIA’s Worst Quarter May Be Behind It, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-09 ,"On the other hand, SIA Engineering’s core EBIT loss widened q-o-q from S$9m in the 1Q to S$16m in the 2Q due to a reduction in the volume of maintenance work as airlines globally grounded most of their fleet. See report: SIA Engineering - CGS-CIMB Research 2020-11-04: Pending Changi Airport Traffic."
Singapore Airlines  - SIA’s Worst Quarter May Be Behind It, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-09 ,We expect SIA’s core net losses in the 2H to narrow sequentially against the 1H due to the cautious reopening of Singapore’s borders to a select group of countries (including the Singapore-Hong Kong travel bubble from later this month) and the onset of the peak airfreight season in the current quarter.
Singapore Airlines  - SIA’s Worst Quarter May Be Behind It, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-11-09 ,"Furthermore, we believe that SIA likely completed the transfers of the accumulated MTM fuel derivative losses into the P&L in 4QFY20 and 1HFY21 and these should not recur in 2HFY21F while the asset impairments are also likely over, for now at least."

Singapore Airlines  - No Urgency (Yet) To Add SIA Shares, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-10-26 ,"While Singapore has largely contained its COVID-19 outbreak and is cautiously reopening its borders, there seems to be an abundance of caution among governments elsewhere that may delay the full reopening of borders to non-essential, leisure travel. Furthermore, the pandemic is seeing resurgence in some neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, and has not been effectively controlled in India, Indonesia and the Philippines, which were erstwhile the source of a lot of transfer traffic at Changi airport."
Singapore Airlines  - No Urgency (Yet) To Add SIA Shares, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-10-26 ,"Farther away, the high number of cases in certain parts of Europe and the US also prevent SIA from resuming its hub-and-spoke air transportation business model; origin and destination traffic only produce a limited number of passengers given Singapore’s small size."

Singapore Airlines  - No Urgency (Yet) To Add SIA Shares, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-10-26 ,"Singapore has initiated reciprocal green lane arrangements with several countries for official and business travel without requiring quarantine, but passenger numbers are naturally low given the paperwork involved and the necessary sponsorships. Unrestricted general travel into Singapore has been unilaterally initiated with several small countries, with no quarantine and no itinerary restrictions, but the foreign countries are not reciprocating Singapore’s moves, with the possible exception of Hong Kong."
Singapore Airlines  - No Urgency (Yet) To Add SIA Shares, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-10-26 ,"We think investors should stay on the sidelines on SIA shares, with key catalysts for us to be more constructive being the emergence of widely-available COVID-19 vaccines. This is not likely to be available until 1HCY21, based on World Health Organization guidance. IATA expects a full recovery of passenger demand to the 2019 baseline only in 2024."
Singapore Airlines  - No Urgency (Yet) To Add SIA Shares, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-10-26 ,"Meanwhile, we expect SIA to deliver a very poor set of Sep 2020 quarter results (to be reported in Nov), with a second-consecutive quarter of 98-99% y-o-y drop in demand. SIA guided on 29 Jul that its group passenger ASK capacity “may reach less than half of its pre-COVID-19 levels” by the end of Mar 2021."
Singapore Airlines  - No Urgency (Yet) To Add SIA Shares, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-10-26 ,"SIA’s largest A380s (and oldest 777s) are likely to be impaired by at least S$1bn according to SIA in the September 2020 quarter results; while non-cash in nature, the impairments reflect difficulties in finding profitable employment for the A380s in the medium-term."
Singapore Airlines  - No Urgency (Yet) To Add SIA Shares, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-10-26 ,"As Brent crude oil prices did not move much from the US$40-41/bbl level between 30 Jun and 30 Sep 2020, SIA did not benefit from any mark-to-market gains on fuel derivatives in excess of its actual requirements. SIA had purchased Brent forwards for the next 5 years, with mark-to-market fuel derivative losses of c.S$2.6bn."
Singapore Airlines  - No Urgency (Yet) To Add SIA Shares, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-10-26 ,"Certainly, the continued global border closures and the limited levels of travel allowed between Singapore and other countries suggest that “half” or even close to half, may be too ambitious a target, in our view."

Singapore Airlines  - No Urgency (Yet) To Add SIA Shares, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-10-26 ,"SIA enjoys a strong financial position given that it has access to S$15bn in equity funding and the company has already raised more than S$2bn in additional borrowings as at late-July 2020. On the other hand, given that international aviation requires perhaps up to 2024 before recovering to the 2019 baseline of passenger traffic, according to IATA, we think that there is no rush to invest in SIA until a COVID-19 vaccine becomes more widely available from 2HCY21 onwards, or if an effective COVID-19 drug is released. This explains our Hold rating on the stock."
Singapore Airlines  - No Urgency (Yet) To Add SIA Shares, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-10-26 ,"We have tweaked upwards our target price based on a lower P/BV of 0.75x, from 0.84x previously (still pegged to -1 standard deviation from the mean since 2011). We think that a P/BV multiple of -2 standard deviations from the mean would be too onerous on SIA, as we have rolled forward our valuation basis to the adjusted end-FY23F BVPS of S$4.84 (from the end-FY22F BVPS) in order to capture as much of the expected losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic as possible. Once a global aviation recovery becomes more certain, the market may be more comfortable with higher P/BV multiples."
Singapore Airlines  - No Urgency (Yet) To Add SIA Shares, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-10-26 ,"To derive our BVPS forecasts, we have assumed that SIA will raise a further S$6.2bn in additional MCBs in FY22F, in addition to the S$3.5bn of MCBs issued on 8 June 2020.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,"Singapore’s formation of travel bubbles is likely to gain momentum in the next three months. Together with the government’s proposal to provide COVID-19 travel insurance, this reduces the risk profile of travellers. We are now more positive on cargo operations rather than the recovery in pax traffic, especially from higher freight rates when the vaccine dissemination gets underway."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,We now value Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) at the same P/B multiple as Cathay Pacific Airlines. Upgrade Singapore Airlines to BUY.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,"In what must be the first move by any country, the Singapore government announced yesterday that it will provide subsidies and insurance coverage for Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders who develop COVID-19 symptoms within 14 days of their return. We believe this move will boost confidence in air travel, leading to more advance bookings and improving Singapore Airlines (SIA)’s cash flow."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,"On the same day that Singapore announced the COVID-19 travel insurance, the Singapore media reported that a National University of Singapore start-up had developed a 1-minute COVID-19 breath analyser which has a greater than 90% efficacy. Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University is also developing a rapid COVID-19 test which could deliver results in 37 minutes."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,"At present, pre-departure COVID-19 test costs about S$200 in Singapore and about US$45 in Hong Kong. If such pre-departure test costs are lower, we believe this will further incentivise travel."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,"All in all, we are encouraged by the Singapore government’s efforts to open up Singapore’s borders to countries with low COVID-19 infections."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,"We believe the Singapore government will negotiate with Australia, China, Japan, Taiwan and Thailand to open similar travel corridors with mandatory COVID-19 testing."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,"Presently, cargo operations account for almost 80% of group capacity while load factors achieved a record high of 89% in Sep 20, implying a shortage of cargo capacity. Even if more countries open their borders, we believe Singapore Airlines will continue to add more cargo capacity by:

converting some of Scoot’s A320 aircraft to carry cargo; and
utilising Singapore Airlines’ older B777-300 to carry dedicated cargo."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,"We also believe cargo operations would be much more lucrative than passenger operations. Scoot’s reconfigured A320 can carry almost 20 tonnes of cargo and current cargo rates are at S$5-6/kg, more than double of that in the previous year. Some industry experts believe cargo rates could go up to US$10/kg once vaccines are moved via air."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,"Singapore Airlines has already utilised S$6.2b of its S$8.8b rights proceeds, but highlighted it had S$1.9b in lines of credit and the option to raise another S$6.2b."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,"We had previously highlighted that Singapore Airlines would very likely exercise the rights to the additional convertible bonds (which will be funded by Temasek) by end-Mar 21 and have factored that in our assumptions. See previous report: Singapore Airlines - UOB Kay Hian 2020-08-03: 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery. The carrier had also said that it plans to cut 4,300 positions across the group, which we estimate could lead to S$0.3b in cost savings."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,"Notwithstanding a likely second record mandatory convertible bond (MCB) issuance, we are now more positive on Singapore Airlines. We identify three stock price catalysts:

China and Singapore opening their borders;
Singapore Airlines announcing that it is planning to convert or use more of its passenger aircraft to carry cargo; and
announcement of a global distribution of vaccine."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-22 ,"The last factor is likely to lead to a surge in freight rates in which Singapore Airlines could benefit due to Singapore’s status as a transhipment hub. Similarly, we believe that as demand for travel rises, ticket prices are likely to rise sharply. While it is impossible to accurately estimate the impact, we believe the upside risk is greater."

This would be due to substantial working capital funding requirements as well as a dismal outlook for the winter schedule, which will commence in the third week of October. We now assume that Singapore Airlines will issue S$6.2b in MCB by end-Mar 21. This would be dilutive to equity holders."

Singapore Aviation Sector  - Focus On ST Engineering For Dividend Yield; Raise Target Price For SATS To S$3.40, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-10-08 ,"American Airlines and United Airlines have already commenced furloughing employees and this is likely to lead to further capacity cuts, which in turn will lead to lower aircraft maintenance revenue. Thus, aerospace divisions in 2H20 could see a decline larger than the 17% y-o-y (ex-M&A) decline in 1H20."

Next, a reduction in losses from associates would be vital for an earnings recovery as ASEAN and Greater China associates - including consolidated Nanjing Weizhou - contributed 68% of losses in 1QFY21. At this stage, we are unsure of the ability of associates to lower wage costs due to stricter labour laws."

Aviation  - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-09-11 ,"We are not confident that borders will reopen by end-20 and thus do not expect any improvement for SIA or SATS. However, if a vaccine is developed by year-end or 1Q21, SATS will benefit directly via the provision of critical pharmaceutical logistics and the handling for the Asia-Pacific region."
Aviation  - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-09-11 ,"Meanwhile, ST Engineering could benefit from higher maintenance works on return-to-service checks for grounded aircraft ahead of an anticipated traffic recovery. Maintain MARKET WEIGHT on the sector."

Aviation  - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-09-11 ,"Newsflow has been generally positive on the development of vaccines with China’s CNBG and SinoVac announcing plans to roll out three COVID-19 vaccines by end-20 with a combined production volume of 600m doses by 2020. While AstraZeneca has paused trials after an adverse reaction in one among the thousands of participants, the general expectation is that a working vaccine would be available by early-21. The World Health Organisation (WHO) expects mass vaccination to commence only by mid-21."
Aviation  - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-09-11 ,"The majority of Asian countries continues to impose 14-day quarantine on all arrivals. Even if leisure travels were to be allowed (such as in Japan for specific countries), travellers face the prospects of a cumulative 28-day quarantine which will likely discourage travel."

Aviation  - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-09-11 ,"ST Engineering (SGX:S63) has aircraft maintenance hangars in China and the US. In China, its hangars are in key hubs in Guangzhou and Shanghai and flight movements out of China have recovered to 80% of pre-Covid levels as at August, due to a rapid recovery in domestic traffic. Still, ST Engineering’s biggest aerospace exposure is in the US where about 50% of aircraft is still grounded. If more Americans opt to be vaccinated, then airlines would restore grounded aircraft to service."
Aviation  - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-09-11 ,"ST Engineering will benefit from return-to-service checks for temporarily parked aircraft and more extensive flight worthiness check on airlines grounded for longer periods, although this is likely to take place in early-21 at best."
Aviation  - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-09-11 ,Employees in the aviation and the marine sectors will benefit from an additional 7 months of payout with subsidy of 50% and 30% respectively under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS). We have assumed ST Engineering will receive about S$90m in additional JS payout for 2021.
Aviation  - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-09-11 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) could potentially exhaust its S$8.8b in rights and convertible debt proceeds by end-Mar 21 unless it manages to defer a large part of the S$2.0b in advance payments for flights. As of August, the carrier had utilised S$4.4b of the proceeds with S$2.9b used for debt repayment and S$1.1b for ticket refunds and settlement of fuel hedging contracts. However, SIA had S$5.5b in current trade-related liabilities (including S$2b in advance bookings) and S$1.6b in derivative liabilities as at end-Mar 20. Even assuming the derivative liabilities diminish in value, we estimate SIA would have at least a further S$6b in payables by end-Mar 21."
Aviation  - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-09-11 ,SIA also had S$2.7b in short-term debt as at end- FY20 but we believe this has been fully repaid as at Aug 20.
Aviation  - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-09-11 ,"In addition, from an operating perspective, we estimate SIA would be burning S$200m-300m per quarter inclusive of lease payments for 2Q-3QFY21."

Aviation  - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-09-11 ,"SATS (SGX:S58)'s Coolport@Changi is ISO certified and is the world’s first centre of excellence for pharmaceutical handling. Given Singapore’s status as a key transshipment hub, SATS is likely to play a significant role in the transportation and storage of vaccines to the Asia-Pacific region."
Aviation  - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-09-11 ,"SATS’ Indonesian associate PT JAS is also certified to handle pharmaceutical products. IATA has called for the special air traffic rights in support of the delivery of vaccines as well as tariff relief and priority of arrival to prevent temperature excursions due to delays. IATA has also indicated that a single dose of vaccine to the entire world population would require 8,000 B747 Jumbo Jets, which is about half the global fleet of all commercial aircraft prior to COVID-19."

Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,"We now expect full-year losses to double our previous estimate, in part due to the guidance of S$1b in impairment for surplus aircraft as well as slower capacity growth for FY21 and FY22."
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,"The key bright spots are a doubling in pax yields, which suggests that airlines will have pricing power when traffic rebounds, as well as strong cargo yields and revenue."
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,Another potentially bright spot is a delay in aircraft deliveries and capex.
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,We now value Singapore Airlines at 0.85x FY21F’s diluted book value and derive a fair value of S$3.64.

1QFY21 loss was broadly in line; excluding ineffective hedges, SIA was likely to have been EBITDA positive."
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,"Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) had warned earlier that it will close out part of the its fuel hedges due to a reduction in capacity and this led to S$464m in ineffective fuel hedging. Excluding that, we estimate that Singapore Airlines would have been EBITDA positive for the year (approximately S$40m)."
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,"Cargo operations were the sole bright spot and accounted for 78% of Singapore Airlines’ revenue for the period, with the carrier deploying 33 of its passenger aircraft for cargo only services. Cargo yields rose a whopping 174% y-o-y in 1Q20, due to a shortage of bellyhold capacity and strong demand for personal protection equipment."
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,"Group-wide non-fuel cost fell 54% y-o-y for the period, lower than the 79% decline in revenue. The reduction was also aided by wage credits from the Job Support Scheme."
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,"Pax yields doubled for the parent airline and SilkAir, but it was still in the red as breakeven level was still at 149% vs load factors of 10.8% due to low capacity utilisation and relatively high fixed costs."
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,"After adjusting for non-cash items and factoring in lease payments, we estimate an operating cash flow deficit of about S$200m."
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,"As at 1QFY21, Singapore Airlines had S$9.6b in cash, a S$6.9b increase from 31 March. Factoring in the S$8.8b in rights issue, a repayment of S$2.0b in bridging facility, short-term loans of S$0.5b as well as S$1b in secured loans, the cash burn for the period would approximate S$1.4b (we had previously assumed that the secured loans were not included in 1QFY21’s cash flow)."
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,The carrier has 19 A380’s of which 5 are on operating leases. We have now factored the non-cash impairment charges in FY21’s earnings estimates. Singapore Airlines guided that they have completed discussions with Airbus and discussions are currently on-going with Boeing.
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,Singapore Airlines had previously guided for S$5.3b and S$5.7b in capex for FY21 and FY22 respectively. We now assume that capex for FY21 and FY22 would be halved from prior guidance.
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,Singapore Airlines also guided that capacity by end-2QFY21 would likely be at just 7% of pre-pandemic levels. We have assumed that group capacity for FY21 and FY22 would be at 11.7% and 33% of pre-pandemic capacity levels.
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,"Not surprisingly, the demand outlook has worsened given increasing concerns over a second wave of infections and risk of quarantine measures. IATA estimates that traffic will only return to pre-pandemic levels by 2024. However, until COVID-19 infections drastically slow down across the globe and vaccines are widely available, confidence in travel is likely to remain muted."
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,"Singapore Airlines has until next June to decide if it would exercise the option, but secured borrowings would certainly be a cheaper funding option and would not be dilutive to shareholders. Thus, Singapore Airlines’ investment merit would only be clearer as we draw into late-4Q20 and early-1Q21. If pax load factors improve to above 40%, then the odds of further Mandatory Convertible Bonds (MCB) issuance would be reduced."
Singapore Airlines  - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-08-03 ,"We raise our Singapore Airlines' net loss estimate for FY21 to S$3.3b from S$1.6b, after factoring in S$1b in impairment and lower load factors."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,SIA's 1QFY3/21 (April 2020 to June 2020) core net loss of S$1bn was significantly higher than our previous FY21F core net loss estimate of S$720m (consensus: S$1.9bn loss).
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,We reverse our short-lived ADD call back to a HOLD rating as the surge in global COVID-19 cases has put paid to our hopes of a quick recovery.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,"Our target price, still based on 0.84x P/BV on the FY22F adjusted BVPS, has been lowered to S$3.55 due to a significant widening of our loss forecasts."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) reported a net loss of S$1,123m for 1Q21 (April 2020 to June 2020), due to an almost 100% drop in pax carried across the FSC and LCC airlines due to COVID-19 lockdowns and border closures, but partially offset by a comfortable increase in cargo revenues and profits."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,"All three passenger airlines – SIA mainline, SilkAir and Scoot – made large operating losses, but the cargo operations delivered a S$332m EBIT, up almost 10-fold on account of higher cargo yields amid a rush of global shipments of personal protective equipment and pharmaceuticals."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,"Aggravating the group loss was SIA’s share of NokScoot’s impairment on its legacy 777 planes totalling S$127m; stripping this out, the 1Q core net loss was S$1bn, which included S$464m in mark-to-market (MTM) losses on ineffective fuel hedges, but also c.S$200m in government jobs support scheme (JSS) receipts."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,"Removing the latter two items, we end up with a 1Q loss of S$743m, or a loss of S$3bn annualised. Adding back our estimate of S$267m in full-year JSS receipts, we end up with a back-of-the-envelope core net loss forecast of S$2.7bn."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,"We are not deducting the MTM losses booked in 1Q, because rising oil prices may actually help SIA book MTM gains in future quarters that could reverse the 1Q MTM losses. Our new core net loss forecast for FY21F is now S$2.4bn, closely matching our estimate above, and making allowance for some improvement in pax traffic over the next three quarters."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,"Our core net loss forecasts for FY21-23F have been widened significantly, because our old assumptions on pax traffic recovery look increasingly improbable in light of the still-worrying levels of COVID-19 infections in major markets for SIA such as Indonesia, India, Australia, Hong Kong and the US, and the reluctance of countries to open their borders prematurely."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,"We had earlier expected FY21F ASK capacity to be c.45% of the baseline in FY20, with FY22F at 75% and FY23F at 90% of the baseline. We have now revised the ASK forecasts to 10%, 50% and 70% of the FY20 baseline in FY21F, FY22F and FY23F, respectively."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,"Long-haul travel on SIA mainline will likely take longer to recover than medium-haul travel, which in turn may take longer to recover than short-haul travel on SilkAir and Scoot. This is a major challenge for SIA, as the long-haul operations generate the biggest chunk of profits and employ the most expensive assets. SIA is undergoing an asset impairment review, and may book a S$1bn impairment on its 19-strong A380 fleet as well as additional impairments on the values of older-generation planes."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,"SIA typically recognises only realised MTM fuel hedging gains/losses in the P&L, with unrealised MTM gains/losses booked in balance sheet reserves."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,"The collapse in demand and the substantial cut in capacity mean that SIA does not foresee requiring the same number of oil hedges that it had contracted. The excess barrels can no longer be considered as hedges, hence the unrealised MTM gains/losses on those excess barrels can no longer be booked in balance sheet reserves. Instead, unrealised MTM gains/losses on those excess barrels must be booked into the P&L immediately."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-07-30 ,"The value of the unrealised MTM gains/losses on the excess barrels is re-measured quarterly, based on the prevailing forward oil price curve, with the difference booked into the P&L.

Unrealised MTM gains on excess FY21F hedges, given that Brent crude oil prices doubled between 31 March and 30 June 2020, hence requiring a re-measurement of the unrealised MTM losses that were originally booked in 4QFY20; and
Unrealised MTM losses on the fuel derivatives that are in excess of its actual requirements for FY22F. During the 1Q, SIA revised lower its estimates for capacity restoration in FY22F, resulting in a decline in forecast oil consumption. The unrealised MTM losses on the over-hedged position with respect to FY22F was recognised in 1QFY21 by way of a charge in the P&L.

Hence, we now project Singapore Airlines’ overall revenue in FY21 to decline by 61% y-o-y to S$6.3bn on passenger capacity cut of 63% y-o-y, and with operating losses of S$2.2bn (versus our previous forecast of S$1.3bn operating loss)."

Lowered aircraft capex by S$600m for FY21, while non-airline capex lowered by S$100m for the same period."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At Critical Crossroads, But Negatives Fully Priced In", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-05-18 ,Total aircraft capex and pre-delivery payments were lowered by just S$600m for the next three years and still could amount to S$14.9b. Non-aircraft related capex was lowered by S$200m to S$800m for the next 3 years.
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At Critical Crossroads, But Negatives Fully Priced In", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-05-18 ,We have assumed that SIA will also sell and leaseback aircraft for approximately S$400m and have also assumed further asset disposal of S$2.9b. Excess capacity remains a key risk for SIA over the next 2 years even if traffic recovers.
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At Critical Crossroads, But Negatives Fully Priced In", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-05-18 ,"Even if there is a recovery, it would be more skewed towards short-haul routes, rather than long haul routes.

"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - At Critical Crossroads, But Negatives Fully Priced In", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-05-18 ,"We believe the best way to enhance shareholder value would be for SIA to sell aircraft as the market improves in 1-2 years or if that fails, monetise unencumbered aircraft with attached leases."

Singapore Airlines (SIA) - Opportunity To Accumulate"
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,SIA's full-year core net loss of S$127m outperformed our S$140m core net profit forecast if we add back S$710m in unrealised MTM losses on fuel hedges.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,"The outperformance was due to a sharp S$500m (-65% q-o-q) drop in staff costs, which exceeded our expectations."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,Upgrade from Hold to ADD as the deeply-discounted share price may recover once Covid-19 outbreak eases; target price raised to S$4.60 (0.84x P/BV).
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) reported a core net loss of S$699m for 4QFY20 and a full-year core net loss of S$127m."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,"SIA typically accounts for unrealised MTM hedging gains and losses on its fuel derivatives on its balance sheet and only recognises realised hedging gains/losses on its P&L. However, in 4QFY20, SIA charged S$710m in unrealised MTM fuel hedging losses from the FY21F hedge book into its P&L, representing the excess of the barrels hedged compared to the expected consumption."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,"If we add this back to derive the ‘actual’ operating performance, SIA would have been approximately breakeven in 4QFY20 and still profitable for FY20, in part due to the aggressive cost cuts. Salary costs, for instance, fell 65% q-o-q, or S$500m, to just S$274m in 4QFY20 due to a combination of pay cuts, reduced flying allowances and voluntary/involuntary no-pay leave."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,"Still, this does not hide the tough conditions facing the group as the combined passenger business saw RPK demand contract 23% y-o-y and yields fall 6.4% y-o-y in 4QFY20, with MI and TR in the red and SQ merely breakeven (after adding back the unrealised MTM losses). The stronger cargo yields certainly helped SQ, although this was mostly offset by lower cargo volumes."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,"We have reduced our FY21F core net loss estimate from S$957m to S$720m as the MTM fuel hedging loss of S$710m charged into the FY20 P&L means that an equivalent value will no longer be charged into the FY21F P&L unless, of course, the Brent forward curve falls further from the end-Mar 2020 level."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,"However, if the OPEC+ oil production cuts succeed in increasing oil prices, SIA will benefit from MTM fuel hedging gains on the over-hedged portion, which will be booked in the FY21F P&L. Meanwhile, SIA will remain fully hedged on its now-reduced FY21F fuel requirements and is therefore not expected to suffer any economic loss on this effective portion of the hedge even if spot oil prices increase. In other words, if oil prices increase, MTM fuel hedging gains may help SIA improve its FY21F P&L performance, which may surprise the market positively."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,"There are many uncertainties, however, and we now assume that SIA’s combined passenger airline business will see a 57% y-o-y RPK decline in FY21F vs. our previous -43% assumption."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,"Yield decline assumptions also remain highly judgmental at this point but, with the SIA share price trading at 0.69x historical P/BV, below even the P/BV of 0.74x that is 2 s.d. below the mean, a lot of negative news appears to be priced in."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,Investors with a high risk tolerance and a one-year investing horizon can accumulate SIA for the eventual relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions and a share price relief rally.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,"Our target price of S$4.60 remains based on 0.84x P/BV, using 1 standard deviation (s.d.) below the mean since 2011."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,"We have applied this multiple against the end-FY22F book value per share (BVPS) of S$5.47 because we expect SIA to report losses in both FY21F and FY22F. Hence, we have used the lowest possible BVPS in our forecast period to incorporate a margin of safety."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Opportunity To Accumulate, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-15 ,Our BVPS also treats half of the S$3.5bn Mandatory Convertible Bonds (MCB) as debt (although the accounting treatment sees it as wholly equity) because we have assumed that SIA will endeavour to redeem half of the MCBs before their 10-year maturity or will refinance them using other sources of debt.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 4QFY20F To Be In The Red Due To Fuel Hedges, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-08 ,Singapore Airlines in its trading update today said its 4QFY3/20F P&L will be adversely affected by MTM losses on a part of its outstanding FY21F fuel hedges.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 4QFY20F To Be In The Red Due To Fuel Hedges, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-08 ,We have already reflected these MTM losses in our balance sheet forecasts and hence this has no impact on our S$4.45 target price (P/BV of 0.84x).
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 4QFY20F To Be In The Red Due To Fuel Hedges, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-08 ,"Maintain HOLD, because we see no catalysts to SIA's share price given the uncertainty over how quickly Covid-19 can be brought under control."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 4QFY20F To Be In The Red Due To Fuel Hedges, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-08 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) issued a trading update today and also hosted a short analyst conference call. Key highlights are as follows.

First, SIA mainline and SilkAir have extended their combined capacity cuts of 96% from late-Mar to end-Jun 2020. Scoot is expecting capacity cuts of 98% in that time period.
Second, SIA has seen strong cargo demand, and hence has maximised the utilisation of its freighters and even used passenger aircraft for cargo-only flights. Cargo yields have improved in 4QFY20F and also in 1QFY21F.
Third, a certain portion of the contracted fuel hedges for FY21F (which we estimate at 30m bbl), are in excess of SIA group’s actual fuel requirements (our estimate: 25m bbl), hence the excess has been classified as ‘ineffective hedges’ where the mark-to-market (MTM) losses will be recognised in the 4QFY20F P&L.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 4QFY20F To Be In The Red Due To Fuel Hedges, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-08 ,"Usually, SIA’s accounting policy is for the MTM gains/losses to be booked into its balance sheet reserves, and this policy is still being applied to the portion of fuel hedges in FY21F which are in line with SIA group’s actual requirements and also to the outstanding fuel hedges maturing in FY22-25F. It expects no additional hedging activity, and no restructuring of existing hedges either."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 4QFY20F To Be In The Red Due To Fuel Hedges, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-08 ,"Fourth, because of the expected MTM losses, SIA group will post a “material operating loss” for 4QFY20F.

In the last SIA guidance released in Nov 2019, SIA said it had planned for S$6bn in capex for FY21F. But with certain project capex delayed (like IT capex) and with the renegotiation of aircraft deliveries and retrofit scheduled, the capex is likely to be lower, and SIA will release new guidance at its FY21F results on 14 May, with the analyst briefing on 15 May."

For 2QFY21F (Jul-Sep 2020F), we previously forecast that pax volumes would only be 12% lower y-o-y across the group, including Scoot (TR), but we revise our estimate to a 60% y-o-y decline as we do not believe the q-o-q demand recovery will be as sharp as expected previously."

However, for the purposes of deriving our target price, we have assumed that half of the MCBs is akin to debt as we believe SIA will endeavour to redeem at least some before its 10-year maturity, resulting in a lower BVPS of S$5.30."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Widening Loss Forecast For FY21F, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-05-06 ,"Applying a target P/BV multiple of 0.84x on our revised BVPS of S$5.30 results in a price target of S$4.45.

Singapore 2020 Supplementary Budget  - Providing More Pain Relief, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-27 ,"For F&B service companies, staff cost accounts for approximately 17% and 30% of Koufu (SGX:VL6)’s and Jumbo Group (SGX:42R)’s revenues respectively. Based on the dependency ratio ceiling (DRC) for the services sector, we estimate local hires command approximately 70% of its total workforce. Based on these assumptions, our back-of-envelope calculations indicates an additional (from last round) cash grant of roughly S$7.0m (25% of 2019 earnings) and S$3.5m (30% of 2019 earnings) for Koufu and Jumbo Group respectively."
Singapore 2020 Supplementary Budget  - Providing More Pain Relief, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-27 ,"Although the cost savings does help support earnings, we think it acts more as a cushion and we still expect a net negative impact to earnings from COVID-19, given that the situation has deteriorated and additional travel restrictions have been put in place."

Rental waiver to cushion higher costs."

We believe that Sheng Siong (SGX:OV8) and Koufu will be eligible given that both the companies lease a significant number of HDB shop units. Given that Koufu would likely have to pass on some of the cost savings to stall tenants in coffee shops and food courts, the main beneficiary of the scheme would be Sheng Siong, in our view."
Singapore 2020 Supplementary Budget  - Providing More Pain Relief, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-27 ,"Our back-of-envelope calculations indicate c.S$2.4m (3.2% of earnings) for the 1.5 months additional waiver. Further, we estimate Sheng Siong would also receive an additional (from last round) cash grant of S$6m-6.5m, or 7.9-8.6% of 2019 earnings for the enhanced JSS. That said, these cost savings could be used to cushion the potential increase in input prices from supply chain disruptions."

The government is also providing a one-time waiver of $100 outward conversion fee for private hire car owners to enjoy lower insurance premiums, easing transition to other jobs.

Ammunition for landlords to help tenants."
Singapore Supplementary Budget  - Unprecedented Anti-Viral Boost, DBS Research , Janice CHUA  | Kee Yan YEO  [CMT] | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-27 ,"We believe that the enhanced property tax rebates will come as a relief to landlords as most are balancing the need to provide help to their tenants due to COVID-19 and economic downturn. At the same, this should help to stem the risk of potential tenant closures (and unwarranted vacancies spiking in the near term). The increase in property tax rebate from 30% to 100% for the most directly impacted sectors (retail, hospitality and MICE) will be timely for landlords."
Singapore Supplementary Budget  - Unprecedented Anti-Viral Boost, DBS Research , Janice CHUA  | Kee Yan YEO  [CMT] | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-27 ,"With calls from government to pass down the rebates to the tenants, we believe most landlords will do so and provide more (on top of marketing efforts for retailers) in the immediate term. The hoteliers will also be able to mitigate near term losses as island-wide occupancies drop towards the low 30%-35% with Singapore limiting entry to tourists (passenger traffic at the airport since the lockdown has fallen more than 90%)."
Singapore Supplementary Budget  - Unprecedented Anti-Viral Boost, DBS Research , Janice CHUA  | Kee Yan YEO  [CMT] | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-27 ,"While hoteliers are seeing a slight lift in occupancies from Malaysians (who chose to stay in Singapore) post the lock-down in Malaysia and stay-home-notices (SHN) for returning travellers, average daily rates (ADR) are generally lower than usual."

Singapore Supplementary Budget  - Unprecedented Anti-Viral Boost, DBS Research , Janice CHUA  | Kee Yan YEO  [CMT] | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-27 ,"Based on our estimates, the property tax rebates work out to roughly 1 month of rent for retail landlords and hospitality landlords (c.9% of revenues) and 10 days of rent for commercial and industrial landlords."

Moreover, Singapore Airlines [HOLD; FV: S$6.60] announced last evening a proposed renounceable rights issue with the support of Temasek, its largest shareholder. Shareholders will be offered S$5.3b in new equity and up to an additional $9.7b via mandatory convertible bonds (MCB).

The rights issuance will be subject to shareholders’ approval at EGM and Temasek will vote in favour of the issuance and to subscribe to its pro-rata entitlement as well as to subscribe to any unsubscribed rights shares or remaining rights in the MCBs."
Singapore Travel and Hospitality  - Enhanced Supportive Measures, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-03-27 ,"We see the support from Temasek as timely to Singapore Airlines. To date, Singapore Airlines has cut 96% of its capacity due to widen border controls. Singapore Airlines has been proactively looking at ways to mitigate cost pressures and is in discussions with banks for funding.

Enhance Broad-Based Support for Tourism Sector - Business in tourism sector such as licensed hotels, travel agencies will receive grants which will offset 75% of the gross monthly wages (cap at monthly wage of S$4,600) of their local workers. A tax rebate of 100% will be granted to qualifying commercial properties, including hotels, serviced apartments, prescribed MICE venues, and international cruise and regional ferry terminals. This was revised up from the 15-30% property tax rebated announced earlier during the Budget 2020.
Enhance Training Industry Professionals in Tourism Grant - Singapore Tourism Board (STB) will maximise its support level to 90% for course fees and trainer fees for tourism-related courses.
Enhance Other Tourism Grants - The measure aims to maximise grants for qualifying program or events costs.

We cut full year passenger capacity for FY21F to a 20% y-o-y decline leading to a 25% y-o-y drop in revenue:"
Singapore Airlines  - SIA's Toughest Challenge Yet, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-03-19 ,"We now factor in a 50% y-o-y decline in passenger capacity for Singapore Airlines and Silkair in the months of March and April, a 75% y-o-y decline in May and a more moderate cut of 50% in June, with steady recovery in capacity and demand by the end of 2020. (See table in attached PDF report)."
Singapore Airlines  - SIA's Toughest Challenge Yet, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-03-19 ,"Coupled with weaker load factors and yields, we project overall revenue for 1QFY21 (the quarter ending June) to decline by 66% y-o-y, with an operating loss of S$1bn, before narrowing to an operating loss of S$500m in 2Q20. Our quarterly forecasts assume a normalisation of travel demand and earnings by 4Q20."

Fuel hedging losses to be substantial."
Singapore Airlines  - SIA's Toughest Challenge Yet, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-03-19 ,"At the end of Dec 2019, Singapore Airlines had hedged 79% of its projected 4Q19 jet fuel consumption at US$76 per barrel and 73% of its FY21F fuel consumption at between US$58/bbl for Brent (22%) and US$74/bbl for jet fuel (51%)."
Singapore Airlines  - SIA's Toughest Challenge Yet, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-03-19 ,"With the slash in capacity in the months ahead, Singapore Airlines has now more fuel volume hedged than it will consume in the next few months and is effectively long on oil price for the next two quarters. With the precipitous drop in demand for oil (jet fuel being one of them), oil prices are likely stay low in the months ahead, which will lead to substantial fuel hedging losses for Singapore Airlines."
Singapore Airlines  - SIA's Toughest Challenge Yet, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-03-19 ,"
Projecting a full-year operating loss of S$1.27bn for SIA in FY21F."
Singapore Airlines  - SIA's Toughest Challenge Yet, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2020-03-19 ,"A weak 4Q19 is expected to drag down FY20 full-year EBIT to S$300m while FY21F full-year EBIT is projected to be a loss of S$1,263m on a full-year revenue decline of 25% y-o-y. This includes an estimated fuel hedging loss of S$1.2bn in FY21F."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - MTM Losses & COVID-19 To Hit Balance Sheet, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-12 ,"SIA's share price has gone below its sustainable long-term valuation, in our view, even after taking into account the damage wrought by Covid-19."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - MTM Losses & COVID-19 To Hit Balance Sheet, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-12 ,"After taking into account MTM losses on its fuel hedges, we cut our target price to S$8, still based on P/BV of 0.86x (1 s.d. below average since 2011)."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - MTM Losses & COVID-19 To Hit Balance Sheet, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-12 ,"We reiterate HOLD, as the spread of Covid-19 to the US and Europe may hurt Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)’s long-haul routes, and SIA's share price may still fall in the short term."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - MTM Losses & COVID-19 To Hit Balance Sheet, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-12 ,"The Covid-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in Europe, and the whole of Italy has been locked down, with cases in the US also rising quickly. European flights currently account for 31% (the single-largest share) of SIA’s mainline (SIAM) available seat kilometre (ASK) capacity, with US flights at 14%. Demand for travel to SW Pacific has also been hurt, affecting 23% of SIAM’s ASK deployment, while demand to NE Asia (14% of ASK) and South Asia (7% of ASK) has also been hurt. SIA mainline and SilkAir combined have cut 15.6% of their ASK capacity for Feb-May 2020, but this is probably lagging the actual demand contraction. We view the global spread of Covid-19 with alarm as the sharp fall in demand for SIA’s regional flights will now spread to its long-haul flights and, in the process, hurt the take-up rate of lucrative business and first class cabins."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - MTM Losses & COVID-19 To Hit Balance Sheet, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-12 ,"The impact on SIA group’s earnings is hard to estimate accurately, as it will depend on the duration and magnitude of the pandemic, and how long it will take to be controlled. The assessment of one expert in Singapore that ‘the virus is here to stay until end-2020’ is bad news for SIA. It would appear, in our view, that the ‘all-clear’ sign is still months away, hence investors may remain cautious even at the current low share price levels."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - MTM Losses & COVID-19 To Hit Balance Sheet, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-12 ,"Our forecasts assume that the SIA group will continue to see lower y-o-y capacity, demand, load factor and yields in FY21F, and we think that core net profits will be suppressed at the S$200m-250m level for both FY20F and FY21F, before a sharp rise to above S$600m in FY22F, assuming that there are no further shocks."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - MTM Losses & COVID-19 To Hit Balance Sheet, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-12 ,"We estimate a S$1.9bn balance sheet hit in 4QFY20F from mark-to-market (MTM) losses on SIA’s outstanding fuel hedges, which have been contracted for the next five years."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - MTM Losses & COVID-19 To Hit Balance Sheet, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-12 ,"The MTM losses are calculated using the Brent crude forward price curve as at 12pm GMT+8 (spot price of US$34/bbl, per-barrel average forward price for FY21-25F of US$40, US$45, US$50, US$51, and US$53, respectively). The estimated MTM loss will reduce our end-Mar 2020F BVPS to S$8.71 (from S$11.23 as at 31 Mar 2019). Our end-Mar 2021F BVPS rises to S$9.33, on the assumption of a US$5/bbl rise in the forward curve, against which we apply a P/BV of 0.86x (1 s.d. below the average since 2011), to derive our target price of S$8."

Singapore Strategy - Going Into Deeper Value Zone"
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"For stock markets to rally convincingly, the crucial ingredient is confidence, now lacking amid oil price crash, rate cuts and global pandemic."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"We cut our end-2020 FSSTI target to 2,595 (12.2x CY21F P/E; -2 s.d of 10- year mean) on -13% decline in FY20F EPS. FY21F EPS growth of 4% at risk."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"Any rebound in market should be used as a selling opportunity, waiting for lower entry. In this report, we screened for names near our conviction buys."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"With a variety of triggers capable of triggering a contagion, the situation now is akin to a perfect storm brewing. Unexpected interest rate cuts by central banks, with possibility of more cuts ahead, imply slower growth. Stimulus measures by many countries to cope with Covid-19 imply potential worsening ahead, and oil price crash intensifies the fear of demand destruction. WHO’s declaration of a global pandemic could change major political and economic ramifications."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"We see vulnerability in banks (NIM cuts, slowdown in loans), developers (potentially slower take-up rates), and some expensive REITs e.g. Keppel DC REIT (SGX:AJBU) (2.07x P/BV, 4% yield)."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"We lower our end-2020F FSSTI to 2,595, still based on -2 s.d. of 10-year mean, as we expect FSSTI EPS to decline 13% in 2020F, factoring in a more severe compression in bank earnings on heightened default risks compounded by the oil price crash. Dearth of oil & gas orders in 2020F is almost inevitable, on top of equipment supply chain disruptions due to Covid-19."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"Our forecast of a c.4% earnings recovery for FSSTI in 2021F incorporated slight pessimism in revenue growth, but we see room for weak operating leverage if a recession sets in (typically when corporate earnings contract for two years)."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"We identify 2,400 as the FSSTI level that reflects recession (2-year average earnings decline of c.20%), and 2,050 as the likely level in the event of a crisis (total 2-year decline of 30%)."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"Our technical analyst now expects further downside to the 2,520 support level. Any rebound near term would likely be temporary, in our view."

Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"The capital goods sector presents the deepest value, with names that could double the money in 3-5 years’ time (but not for the faint hearted). Sembcorp (SGX:U96) (0.4x FY20F P/BV) is only worth 0.8x its utilities' net assets, and everything else is free. Sembcorp Marine (SGX:S51) (0.9x FY20F P/BV), and Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (SGX:BS6) (0.5x FY20F P/BV) have sunk to valuations lower than during the GFC and the oil crisis in 2016 -- due to the oil price crash and anticipation of slower shipbuilding if the global economy softens."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"Central banks around the world have eased monetary policies, not only in response to the current material deterioration in economic activity, but also to the risk of material deterioration in their respective economies. At the same time, many governments are rolling out or have rolled out Covid-19 relief packages to cushion their economies from the impact of its outbreak. However, monetary and fiscal policies cannot overcome a global healthcare crisis."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"Much will also depend on how soon the global fear factor can be contained. Therefore, the general market sentiment would likely remain depressed as the market accesses the threat of contagion risk."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"Last week, International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgieva said global growth in 2020 will dip below last year's levels of 2.9%, but “how far it will fall and how long the impact will be is still difficult to predict""."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"The US Federal Reserve has also signalled its concern over the impact Covid- 19 will have on the US economy when it on 3 Mar unexpectedly slashed its benchmark interest rate by 50bp to 1.25%. Historically, an emergency rate cut of 50bp or more only happened during crisis periods such as at the height of the Dot-Com bubble in Jan 2001 and the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in Sep 2007, kickstarting a bear market. Another 50bp rate cut in its scheduled 18 Mar Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting would mean one full percentage point rate cut in a month, signalling some crack signs in the US economy."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"If the US stock market remains in a risk-off mode even with the monetary support, the ongoing negative sentiment would worsen, leading to a further selloff globally including the FSSTI. Further interest rate cuts to 0.25% by Jun remains a highly probable scenario, according to the Fed Fund Futures. With the zero interest rate policy a possibility, the equity markets would likely remain depressed as the zero interest rate environment suggests a period of weak economic growth."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,The World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of a global pandemic could be the straw that broke the camel’s back.
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"With WHO declaring a pandemic after being reluctant for weeks could hasten our much feared ‘worst case’ scenario. We fear that as the virus rapidly spreads across the world, US and the rest of Europe could see a sharp rise in infection cases and enters into a similar phase as Italy with the risk of sudden widespread outbreak leading to a partial lockdown of countries. This could push the world economy into a full-blown recession, the dreaded ""L"" growth."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"After the past few days' sell-down, the FSSTI now trades at c.12.9x CY21F P/E or 1 s.d. below 10-year mean. Still, we think it has room to de-rate as earnings forecasts can be fragile with our base case play, compounded by the oil price crash and impending rate cuts."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"Our stress tests on banks and capital goods companies, on lower NIM and weaker orders, respectively, on the back of depressed oil prices point to a 13% decline in market EPS for 2020F, with a hope of a 3.8% recovery in 2021F, assuming default risks dissipate. With that, our new FSSTI target is lowered to 2,595, still based on 12.2x CY21F P/E, -2 s.d. of 10-year mean."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"Given the low single-digit earnings growth expectation for 2021F, this puts FSSTI on the verge of a recession if earnings continue to dip, which could bring FSSTI to 2,400 (total earnings decline of 20% in 2 years). Crisis level would see sharper 2-year earnings contraction of 30% or more, sending the FSSTI to 2,100."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"We would look for opportunities to buy, closer to 2,400 points as this level is also cross-checked with most of the analysts' ""comfortable” target entry prices. We go through most of the indexed stocks and small cap alpha picks to explore when would be a good time to buy, and at what price. In our screening process, we also identify the reasons why a stock should or not be valued at GFC levels, with arguments from liquidity and business resilience perspectives."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"On average, stocks still have 30% downside from current values to the “crisis” level, and 18% to fundamental comfortable buy levels."
Singapore Strategy  - Going Into Deeper Value Zone, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-03-12 ,"We list down the top 9 stocks (above US$1bn market cap) that seem to be closer to our comfortable buy levels.

SingTel (SGX:Z74) (target entry: below S$2.70): based on 1 s.d. below its 2006-2020 mean EV/OpFCF. It is currently offering attractive FY20-22F dividend yields of 5.9% p.a. This should provide share price support, as it is close to the 6.1% yield when Singtel's share price hit the trough in Oct 2008 during the GFC. See SingTel Share Price; SingTel Target Price.
Wilmar (SGX:F34) (target entry: below S$3.68): represents 20% below our SOP Target Price of S$4.58 (pricing in listing of its Chinese businesses at 18-22x forward P/E). We do not think it should be pegged to GFC valuations (5.36x P/E) given the current catalyst of listing its China assets. In addition, its integrated business model has allowed the group to produce consistent average core net profit of US$1.2bn over the past 10 years. See Wilmar Share Price; Wilmar Target Price.
Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) (target entry: below S$7.50): based 0.75x historical P/BV pegging to GFC low. Factoring in massive marked to market losses based on forward Brent price curve on 10 March, our BVPS would reduce to S$8.71. See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price.
Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (SGX:BS6) (target entry: below S$0.85). It is trading at 0.48x CY20F P/BV, below GFC (2x P/BV) and 2016 oil crisis (0.6x P/BV), pricing in risks of contract cancellations and slowing order momentum, in our view. Risk to our earnings forecasts is low as we have recently tempered our order expectations to US$1.2bn vs. management's target of US$2bn. YTD order win is about US$320m. Orders dropped to a low of US$450m in 2009. See Yangzijiang Share Price; Yangzijiang Target Price.
ST Engineering (SGX:S63) (target entry: below S$3.84) based on 16.7x FY21F P/E (pegged to trough valuation during oil crisis in 2016). See ST Engineering Share Price; ST Engineering Target Price. Our stress test still points to a 5% y-o-y earnings growth in FY20F, assuming :-

revenue decline for aerospace (aircraft maintenance in FY20F on weaker aviation trend)
revenue decline for electronics (large-scale projects affected by reduced government spending)
50% y-o-y decline in commercial ship repair volume on lower oil prices.


Keppel Corp (SGX:BN4) (target entry: below S$5.15) based on 0.8x CY20F P/BV (pegged to trough during the oil crisis in 2016). The near-term catalyst is the partial offer from Temasek at S$7.35 per share. At current share price of S$5.55 and assuming the partial offer will be effective by 21 Oct 2020 (long-stop date), investor’s purchase price would be S$4.40/share, or a discount of 20% to market value. The caveat for the partial offer to de-rail is if Keppel group’s financial performance and condition deteriorate meaningfully over the period of Oct 2019 to the long-stop date. We do not expect major provisions or sharp plunge in earnings during this period, although the outlook for FY21F-FY22F could be dented by slow offshore & marine orders, and completion of property projects in China. See Keppel Corp Share Price; Keppel Corp Target Price.
Sembcorp (SGX:U96) (target entry: below S$1.64). Current valuations implies SMM is trading at distressed valuations of 0.5x CY20F P/BV and 0.3x CY20F P/BV for its utilities business, ascribing very low confidence on its 9% ROE and S$300m FY20F earnings. We did not pick SMM although it is trading at a new trough of 0.89x CY20F P/BV, a valuation ripe for M&A, as risks prevail with losses likely to persist into its fourth consecutive year in FY21F on lower oil prices and order momentum. See Sembcorp Share Price; Sembcorp Target Price.
Sheng Siong (SGX:OV8) (target entry: below S$1.18): based on long-term average of 20x forward P/E. Earnings growth of 12% in FY20F looks firm on higher store count. See Sheng Siong Share Price; Sheng Siong Target Price.
SingPost (SGX:S08) (target entry: below S$0.71): based on -1 s.d. of long-term mean of 13.7x FY21F P/E. We believe it should not be pegged to its GFC low of 10x P/E as it is a proxy for regional ecommerce growth, making its logistics assets more valuable. Its net cash should sustain yield at 5% in FY21F. See SingPost Share Price; SingPost Target Price.

The near-term catalyst is the partial offer from Temasek at S$7.35 per share. At current share price of S$5.55 and assuming the partial offer will be effective by 21 Oct 2020 (long-stop date), investor’s purchase price would be S$4.40/share, or a discount of 20% to market value. The caveat for the partial offer to de-rail is if Keppel group’s financial performance and condition deteriorate meaningfully over the period of Oct 2019 to the long-stop date. We do not expect major provisions or sharp plunge in earnings during this period, although the outlook for FY21F-FY22F could be dented by slow offshore & marine orders, and completion of property projects in China.

Therefore, we expect further downside to the 2,520 support. Any rebound here in the near term would likely be temporary, and presents a selling opportunity. The resistance at the 2,950-3,000 area would likely limit the upside."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-05 ,"Singapore Airlines said at today’s special briefing on Covid-19 that forward bookings continue to fall, with no bottom in sight yet, as the virus spreads globally."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-05 ,"We reiterate our HOLD call, with an unchanged target price of S$8.46, based on 0.86x CY20F P/BV (1 s.d. below mean since 2011)."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-05 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) said that at the very peak during SARS, there was a 45-50% drop in demand. Right now, the Singapore Airlines group has not yet seen this quantum of decline yet, but the drop in passenger volumes has still been substantial, concentrated on leisure and discretionary travel, and slightly less for business-related travel. The response has been to cut capacity. Even so, passenger loads and yields are still lower y-o-y, forward bookings continue to fall, and have not yet seen bottom, in SIA’s view."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-05 ,"The SIA group’s first wave of capacity cuts were related to Chinese routes in early Feb, with cuts implemented for Scoot, SIA and SilkAir. Scoot, in particular, cancelled all of its flights to China, although the full-service carriers (FSCs) still maintain their core flights to the key cities where there are large populations of Singaporeans."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-05 ,"The second wave of network adjustments concentrated on NE Asia and SE Asia routes, with services maintained in all those cities at lower frequencies. The third wave of cuts was to the US, Europe, SW Pacific and SE Asia, as Covid-19 spread globally."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-05 ,"The Mar 2020 ASK capacity for SIA and SilkAir combined has been reduced 12% y-o-y and 15-16% lower against the original planned schedule. For the Mar-May 2020 period, ASK is down 6.1% y-o-y and 10.3% lower than the original schedule. Scoot’s ASK capacity has been cut 35-40% against its original plan (as China flights made up 25-26% of total capacity, plus with negative secondary impacts on SE Asian demand to travel to China and NE Asia)."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-05 ,"By route region, flights to NE Asia and SE Asia have been reduced by at least 20%, while capacity elsewhere has been cut in the low to high single-digits percentage over the Mar-May period. The Kangaroo route between Europe and SW Pacific was heavily cut for May as it is seasonally weak anyway."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-05 ,"The decision to cut flights depends on which flights cover variable costs and depending on the volume of passengers and load factors. Variable cost breakeven load factor ranges between 40% at the low end, and 60-65% at the high end. The variable cost breakeven load factors vary depending on route yields, aircraft types, route distance, flight operating costs, etc. SIA is concerned about the flights that have variable cost breakeven load factors at the 60-65% level."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-05 ,"SIA has to be mindful about its capacity cuts as the EU is not waiving airlines’ obligation to fly at least 80% of its slots to keep their rights to use the same slots in the next Northern Winter or Northern Summer season. Thankfully, China has waived this obligation temporarily."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-05 ,"SIA is working on securing more lines of credit to support near-term liquidity requirements of the business during the Covid-19 crisis. Currently, SIA has S$1.5bn- 2bn of available credit lines to draw on. SIA is not concerned about raising longer-duration funding for capex requirements. Banks have been supportive of SIA to date."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-05 ,"SIA is discussing with suppliers on getting rate discounts and price concessions, although this remains work-in-progress. SIA is working with aircraft OEM suppliers to reschedule or defer aircraft pre-delivery payment schedules, as well as working to defer non-essential non-aircraft capex in consultation with suppliers."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-03-05 ,"Staff costs will be reduced as the CEO and senior management staff have taken a pay cut, ranging from 5-15%. A voluntary no-pay leave scheme will be offered to staff, including cabin crew and pilots. The S$112m assistance package announced by the government of Singapore is spread over six months across a number of stakeholders, hence will not be material to the SIA group."

Singapore 2020 Budget - Deploying Lifeboats"
Singapore 2020 Budget  - Deploying Lifeboats, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-02-19 ,The major focus is on helping the Singapore economy ride through the negative impact from the COVID-19 outbreak. We see some decent near-term impact from the Budget in selective sectors.
Singapore 2020 Budget  - Deploying Lifeboats, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-02-19 ,"Maintain 2020 year-end FSSTI target of 3,370 (c.5.4% upside), however, we note that there is downside risk should the COVID-19 issue stretch beyond mid-20."
Singapore 2020 Budget  - Deploying Lifeboats, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-02-19 ,"Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister (DPM), Mr Heng Swee Keat delivered the 2020 Budget yesterday. Key highlights from his speech include:

Relief from COVID-19 outbreak. The government plans to spend S$6.4b on various initiatives to assist the economy as well as target key sectors affected by the outbreak, ie aviation, retail, tourism & hospitality. These include various tax rebates, allowance for faster write-downs of investments in plant & equipment and renovation and refurbishment, increase in size of government-backed working capital loans to SMEs and rental waivers.
Goods & Services Tax (GST). The higher GST rate of 9% will not take effect in 2021 and thus the 7% rate will remain in 2021, however the DPM ,stated that the government cannot put off the increase indefinitely as the COVID-19 outbreak has underlined the importance for the government to have recurrent sources of revenue, especially for healthcare. He stated that the GST increase will need to happen by 2025 and the government will provide a S$6b assurance package to cushion the impact when the GST increase comes along.
Transformation to continue. The DPM noted that Singapore needed to be cognisant of four structural shifts in the future: The decline in support for globalisation, the shift in global economic weight towards Asia, the rapid advancement of technology and the country’s transition toward an ageing society. These four issues were addressed in the budget via S$8.4b in spending programmes to assist the country in its transformation.
Climate change initiatives. Following on from the Prime Minister’s National Day Rally speech in Aug 19, the budget outlined various medium to long-term measures to tackle this issue. Much of the measures were focused on electric vehicles (EVs) with the two key items being the phasing out of the use of internal combustion engine vehicles in Singapore by 2040, and expanding the public infrastructure for charging EVs from the current 1,600 charging points to 28,000 by 2030 implying a 33% CAGR. In addition, to prepare Singapore for rising sea levels, the budget allocated S$5b for a new coastal protection fund that the DPM stated would be topped up in the future.
In 2019, Singapore saw a budget deficit of S$1.65b (0.3% of GDP), less than the deficit of S$3.48b forecasted a year ago. In 2020, the budget will remain expansionary, with total expenditure projected to rise 7.0% y-o-y to S$83.61b and an overall budget deficit of S$10.95b or 2.1% of GDP.

In addition, airlines which operated flights from China to Singapore before COVID-19, will receive landing credits while those that operated flights on the sector post COVID-19 will receive 100% landing fee rebates"
Singapore 2020 Budget  - Deploying Lifeboats, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-02-19 ,"Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) - Reduction in landing and parking charges along with rebates could amount to $20m- 25m in cost savings, while cost savings from Jobs Saving Support Scheme could amount to a similar quantum."

CONSUMER (MARKET WEIGHT – unchanged)"
Singapore 2020 Budget  - Deploying Lifeboats, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-02-19 ,"HDB to provide half month worth of rental waivers to commercial tenants. For service-related companies under our coverage, Koufu (SGX:VL6) and Sheng Siong (SGX:OV8) leases a significant number of HDB shop units. While we estimate roughly 50% of Koufu’s outlets are located around HDB estates, we think the cost savings from the rental waiver will potentially be passed on to its stall tenants. For Sheng Siong, we estimate > 70% of its stores are HDB units, some of which are rented from private landlords. We estimate 1.5- 2.1% positive earnings impact, based on an assumption that 35-50% of total rent is paid to HDB. That said, we reckon most of the savings could be used to cushion the increase in input prices should there be supply chain distributions resulting from COVID-19, thus limiting the impact on earnings."
Singapore 2020 Budget  - Deploying Lifeboats, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-02-19 ,"JSS to help companies that are labour intensive with low wage hires. We believe that the scheme could help companies such as Koufu, Jumbo Group (SGX:42R) and Sheng Siong. Labour cost accounts for more than 10% of revenue for the former two while employee-benefit costs forms 30-31% of Jumbo Group’s revenue."
Singapore 2020 Budget  - Deploying Lifeboats, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-02-19 ,"Based on the DRC for the services sector, we estimate local hires command 60-70% of its total workforce. The scheme is limited to local hires and is also subjected to a wage cap of S$3,600, which is approximately the average salary or lower for most of the labor-intensive jobs in the sector. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates cost savings of S$0.5-1.5m from the JSS scheme, as well the enhancement of the Wage Credit Scheme. This translates to a positive earnings impact of roughly 3.6% for Koufu and Jumbo Group, and 1.8% for Sheng Siong."

A rebate (up to 45% on the Additional Registration Fee (ARF), capped at $20,000) on purchases on fully electric taxis as well as a wide deployment of chargers is a more aggressive push for fully electric vehicles. Currently, electric vehicle taxis only make up a small proportion, about 0.7% of the total taxi population in 2019, mainly undertaken by HDT Taxi. A lower road tax for hybrid cars may be a positive, albeit on a marginal extent."

Most retail REITs intend to pass the 15% property tax rebate to their tenants in the form of rent reduction. Many retail REITs are also working on other targeted measures to help their tenants tide through this difficult period. We do not expect any material impact on distributable income for retail REITs.

Singapore 2020 Budget  - Deploying Lifeboats, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-02-19 ,"In order to regulate the inflow of foreign workers, the government has lowered the S-Pass sub-DRC for the construction, process and marine sectors in two phases: phase one will see the DRC decline from 20% to 18% in 2021, and phase two will see this 18% further decline to 15% in 2023."
Singapore 2020 Budget  - Deploying Lifeboats, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-02-19 ,"Keppel Corporation (SGX:BN4) (BUY/ Target: S$7.75) and Sembcorp Marine (SGX:S51) (HOLD/Fair Value: S$1.40) have notably continued their efforts to raise productivity and efficiency in the past few years to offset higher labour costs to mitigate the adverse impact of Singapore's long-term restrictions on foreign labour. In our view, the lower S Pass sub-DRC will have a limited negative impact on Keppel Corporation and Sembcorp Marine."
Singapore 2020 Budget  - Deploying Lifeboats, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-02-19 ,"Providing relief. Without neglecting the medium to longer term challenges that an open economy like Singapore will face, Budget 2020 was very much about providing relief to households as well as those sectors that have been buffeted by the COVID-19 outbreak: aviation, consumer staples, F&B, hospitality, and retail. Lower tourist arrivals as well as government and corporate measures to limit crowds (and thus the spread of the coronavirus) have collectively taken a bite out of consumer spending. We believe that the measures announced today are adequate but could be tweaked in the coming months should things worsen."
Singapore 2020 Budget  - Deploying Lifeboats, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-02-19 ,"Key stocks impacted by Budget 2020. In our coverage, companies such as Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L), SATS (SGX:S58) and SIA Engineering (SGX:S59) in the aviation sector and Koufu (SGX:VL6) and Sheng Siong Group (SGX:OV8) in the consumer staples sectors are key beneficiaries from Budget 2020. Companies that are marginally negatively affected by the lower S Pass sub-DRC ratios include Keppel Corporation (SGX:BN4), Sembcorp Marine (SGX:S51) and ST Engineering (SGX:S63)."
Singapore 2020 Budget  - Deploying Lifeboats, UOB Kay Hian , Singapore Research , 2020-02-19 ,"Weak GDP growth forecasted for 2020. We note that UOB Global Economics Markets Research (UOB GEMR) downgraded its NODX growth outlook to -1.0% y-o-y in 2020, down from a previous +1.5% outlook made in Dec 19. UOB GEMR highlighted downside risks to its newly-formed NODX outlook should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than expected. The downgrade is also expected to drag overall economic growth, where it now expects Singapore’s GDP to grow by merely 0.5% y-o-y in 2020, down from its previous forecast range of between 0.5–1.0%."

Singapore Strategy - Hands Are Tight"
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,Consumer sector could be the biggest winner with cash distribution and grocery vouchers implying a slight uptick in spending. No GST hike in 2021.
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,"We welcome the job support scheme to ease short-term staff costs, but the Covid-19 relief offers very little reprieve to affected industries, in our view."
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,"Stocks with direct implication: Sheng Siong Group (SGX:OV8), Dairy Farm International (SGX:D01), Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L), SATS (SGX:S58), CDL Hospitality Trusts (SGX:J85), Far East Hospitality Trust (SGX:Q5T), UOL Group (SGX:U14), Genting Singapore (SGX:G13), ComfortDelGro (SGX:C52), Jumbo Group (SGX:42R), Yongnam (SGX:AXB) and ST Engineering (SGX:S63)."
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,"The budget is designed to help the population keep jobs and cushion against the negative impact of Covid-19 on corporates. Refer to our economist report for details. From the perspective of equity, the relief offers a mild positive impact to the affected sectors - gaming, hospitality, F&B, aviation, airport services, land transport, retail and SMEs (See Figure2 and Figure3 in attached PDF report for summary)."
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,"We keep our FSSTI target for CY20 at 3,275 pts, based on 12.5x CY21F P/E."
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,"We think the consumer sector (mainly supermarket operators such as Sheng Siong Group (SGX:OV8) and Dairy Farm International (SGX:D01)’s Giant outlets) gains the most, thanks to the implied one-off uptick in spending as a result of cash distribution and grocery vouchers. The labour-intensive structure could also benefit from a short-term jab of job support scheme grants for wages capped at S$3.6k. We expect Sheng Siong Group to generate c.12% EPS growth in FY20F. Upside could come from stronger sales and rebates."
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,The impact from property tax rebates across sectors to cope with potentially lower revenue is generally minimal. The highest rebate (30%) goes to the hospitality sector but the impact of the rebates is likely to be marginal to earnings.
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,"We estimate savings of 1- 2% and 1-3% of NPI and distributable income, respectively, for hospitality REITs. Companies under our coverage with exposure to the hospitality sector include CDL Hospitality Trusts (SGX:J85), Far East Hospitality Trust (SGX:Q5T), OUE Commercial REIT (SGX:TS0U) and Suntec REIT (SGX:T82U) (convention business). For Singapore hotel owners such as UOL Group (SGX:U14), tax savings are minimal at c.1% of net profit."
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,"We think this change will have a neutral to slightly positive impact on share prices of REITs and developers. For hospitality trusts, the operating environment remains challenging with an expected slowdown in tourist arrivals and drag on occupancy and room rates. Trading conditions are likely to remain difficult for retailers, especially those in the discretionary shopping category."
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,"Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) will likely benefit from rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges as these direct costs account for 7% of the group’s opex, but the quantum of the rebates is quite small. We estimate that SIA Group will save at least S$16m-17m in costs over a six-month period, not material against its half-year cash operating costs of c.S$6.5bn."
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,We estimate SATS (SGX:S58) to have one-off savings of c.S$3m on staff costs in the upcoming quarter from the job support scheme. The higher ceiling for the wage credit scheme could also add S$2m- 3m p.a. The total impact is also minimal given that SATS’ staff costs amount to c.S$230m/quarter (or c.47% of average opex).
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,"The upside is if there is any incentive from Changi Airport to reduce SATS’ licence fees (as it did during 2016-17 due to the soft aviation industry then). SATS incurs licence fees of c.S$23m/quarter, or c.5% of average opex."
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,"We are slightly disappointed by the unchanged workers levy as well as the reduction of S Pass DRC for construction and marine sectors. These measures do not help companies such as Keppel Offshore & Marine, Sembcorp Marine (SGX:S51) Marine and Yongnam (SGX:AXB) that have a relatively high reliance on foreign workers."
Singapore Strategy  - Hands Are Tight, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee  | Singapore Research Team , 2020-02-19 ,"Conversely, the smart-nation focus continues as the government will be dishing out S$1bn spending over three years on cyber security and data protection capabilities. ST Engineering (SGX:S63)’s electronic division could see a mild positive from this."

Singapore Airlines  - Look Beyond Near-term Headwinds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-02-18 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)’s 3QFY20 results beat Bloomberg’s consensus and our forecasts. 3QFY20 revenue grew 30% y-o-y to S$4.5b, largely driven by strong passenger revenue (+7.0% y-o-y), partially offset by weak cargo revenue (-17.7% y-o-y)."
Singapore Airlines  - Look Beyond Near-term Headwinds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-02-18 ,"Expenditure rose 1.7% y-o-y to $4.0b, on the back of higher non-fuel expenditure (+4.2% y-o-y) due to growth in capacity and higher traffic, partially offset by lower net fuel costs (-3.6% y-o-y). As such, 3QFY20 net profit grew 10.9% y-o-y to S$315m, as associates and joint ventures’ showed improvement in results and operating performance registered stronger growth."

Singapore Airlines  - Look Beyond Near-term Headwinds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-02-18 ,"SIA’s transformation efforts have started to bear fruits. Passenger growth was strong in 3QFY20, with higher pax load factor (PLF) and RASK (SIA: +1.1%; SilkAir: +3.5%; Scoot: +4.1% y-o-y) across all airlines."
Singapore Airlines  - Look Beyond Near-term Headwinds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-02-18 ,"Despite weak cargo revenue, SIA parent airline outperformed this quarter with double digit growth in operating profit, improvement in RASK and record highs in passenger load factor (85.6%), total revenue (S$4.5b), quarterly available seat-km and revenue passenger-km."
Singapore Airlines  - Look Beyond Near-term Headwinds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-02-18 ,"In terms of operating profit, SilkAir continued to be adversely affected by the transfer of routes to Scoot as well as the 737 Max grounding, yet it managed to record a profit of S$7m (-6.8% y-o-y, turned from a loss of S$3m in 2QFY20 to profit in 3QFY20) due to lower expenditure. In addition, Scoot registered an operating profit of S$4m (+S$3m y-o-y, profit turned from a loss of S$36m in 2QFY19 to profit in 3QFY20), boosted by stronger passenger traffic (+6.8%)."
Singapore Airlines  - Look Beyond Near-term Headwinds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-02-18 ,"In light of COVID-19, the SIA parent airline and SilkAir have reduced frequencies to Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau routes while Scoot has suspended all routes to Mainland China until 28 Mar 2020. We understand that flights to Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau represent ~14% of SIA’s passenger capacity; given that these destinations represent a higher percentage of Scoot’s capacity than the average across the group, we believe it would be hit harder in the near-term than the SIA parent and SilkAir."
Singapore Airlines  - Look Beyond Near-term Headwinds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-02-18 ,Management shared that they will be monitoring the situation closely and manage costs tightly e.g to revisit prepayment schedule for future aircrafts deliveries and to reduce some project expenditures.

Singapore Airlines  - Look Beyond Near-term Headwinds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-02-18 ,"In 1QFY03 which was the worst period of SARS’, SIA’s revenue dropped 35% and suffered a net loss of S$312m. Remarkably, SIA’s performance recovered fairly quickly once SARS was under control in the next quarter. In 2QFY03, SIA returned to profit."
Singapore Airlines  - Look Beyond Near-term Headwinds, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-02-18 ,"With the outbreak of COVID-19, we expect weaker travel demand which will in turn weigh on SIA’s operating performance in 4QFY20/FY21.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Taking Action To Stem The Cash Burn, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-18 ,SIA is focusing on cash preservation by reducing capacity in Feb and Mar (more to come for Apr-May) and cutting certain non-critical capex.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Taking Action To Stem The Cash Burn, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-18 ,"Maintain HOLD with unchanged target price of S$8.46, still based on 0.86x CY20F P/BV (1 s.d. below mean since 2011)."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Taking Action To Stem The Cash Burn, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-18 ,"Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) hosted its regular quarterly briefing yesterday via conference call. It described the Covid-19 as having the greatest impact on demand for its China, HK and Macau flights, followed by flights to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan; demand for some connecting flights that land at the Singapore hub before proceeding to North Asia have been affected as well."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Taking Action To Stem The Cash Burn, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-18 ,"Within ASEAN, demand to Thailand and Vietnam has been the most seriously affected. Yields have been hurt (SIA mainline’s yields fell 6.7% y-o-y during the SARS epidemic in 2QCY03). Flights to China account for 11% of group ASK capacity (6% of SIA mainline’s ASK capacity, 18% of SilkAir, 26% of Scoot) while flights to North Asia ex-China make up 16% of group ASK (18% of SIA mainline, 3% of SilkAir, and 14% of Scoot). SIA said that corporate and business class travel and long-haul travel have been less affected than discretionary leisure travel and short-haul travel. Hence, the LCC Scoot has taken a greater beating than the FSCs. Outbound cargo traffic from China and HK has also been hit hard, hurting SIA Cargo."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Taking Action To Stem The Cash Burn, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-18 ,"SIA has cut flights for Feb and Mar. SIA mainline cut its China seat capacity in Feb and Mar by 54% and to HK by 17%, SilkAir has done the same for its China flights by 59%, while Scoot has cut almost all of its China flights in Feb and Mar, with flights to HK and Macao subject to ad-hoc cancellations. Flights to other parts of North Asia (Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) have not been cut, although SIA is keeping an eye on them with the potential to reduce flights. SIA may extend the capacity cuts to Apr and Mar."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Taking Action To Stem The Cash Burn, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-18 ,"SIA is also looking to preserve cash by deferring non-essential capex, projects, and payments to suppliers.

As the Northern Winter runs for five months during 27 Oct 2019 to 28 Mar 2020, the cuts that the group instituted for Feb and Mar have already exceeded that 20% threshold. SIA needs to pay attention to these limits for the Northern Summer from 29 Mar to 24 Oct 2020."

Singapore Airlines generated operating cash flow of S$868m (+72% y-o-y) in 3QFY20, but was still S$1.53m in negative FCF as at 9MFY20. Interest cover stood at 5.0x as at 9MFY20 (-3.4ppt)"

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY20 In Cash Preservation Mode, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-02-18 ,Scoot’s exposure to the greater China region is about 50% but the carrier has stopped flights to the region. We estimate that capacity to the Greater China region would have been cut by about 8% in Feb-Mar 20.

SIA in cash preservation mode, hopes to defer pre-delivery payments."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY20 In Cash Preservation Mode, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-02-18 ,"The carrier is in talks with its suppliers for easier payment terms and is also reducing flight expenses. Still, the bulk of the burden would be at the capex level and Singapore Airlines is trying to defer pre-delivery payment schedules. The carrier however noted that there is little scope to defer confirmed deliveries over the next 12 months and reaffirmed its capex guidance for the year."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY20 In Cash Preservation Mode, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-02-18 ,Singapore Airlines has yet to ground aircraft and faces the dilemma of reducing operating costs and maintaining an operationally ready fleet if demand picks up.

At critical juncture, SIA could omit final dividend."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY20 In Cash Preservation Mode, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-02-18 ,We have however assumed that Singapore Airlines cut final dividend by 50% to 10 S cents and thus save S$119m. The carrier indicated that it would be seeking more favourable payment terms from suppliers and this could impact SATS (SGX:S58)’s cash flow as well.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY20 In Cash Preservation Mode, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-02-18 ,"We estimate that if sentiment does not improve by mid-March, Singapore Airlines would have to raise additional capital to fund capex and potentially even working capital. As at 9MFY20, Singapore Airlines took on S$1.5b in debt. We estimate Singapore Airlines would need to take on an additional S$1b in debt for 4QFY20."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY20 In Cash Preservation Mode, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2020-02-18 ,"The general perception is that Singapore Airlines plays a critical role in Singapore’s economy and the Singapore government’s shareholding in Singapore Airlines would deem the company as too important to fail.

"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Great 3Q Performance, But 4Q Risks Abound", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-17 ,Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L)'s 9M core net profit of S$488m was 85% of consensus but S$280m more than our full-year forecast of S$208m as we had factored in a large 4Q loss.
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Great 3Q Performance, But 4Q Risks Abound", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-17 ,"Without the Covid-19 impact, Singapore Airlines could outperform our/consensus expectations but the big question now is how large the 4Q loss will be."

"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Great 3Q Performance, But 4Q Risks Abound", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-17 ,"The Singapore Airlines group performed very well, with 3Q core net profit up 33% y-o-y, a strong reversal from the 1H’s 35% y-o-y fall in core net profit."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Great 3Q Performance, But 4Q Risks Abound", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-17 ,"As a recap, the poor 1H performance was on account of the weaker cargo performance (due to the US-China trade war), higher losses at Scoot due to heightened competition with Chinese carriers which impacted RASK and engine problems faced by its 787-9 fleet, higher losses at SilkAir due to the grounding of its 737 MAX 8 fleet, higher non-fuel unit costs (greater staff costs due to more headcount, higher pay rates and higher bonus provisions, larger commission payments), and higher share of associate losses (Virgin Australia and Vistara), all of which more than offset stronger operating performance at SIA mainline (higher loads and RASK due to successful revenue management) and better SIA Engineering (SGX:S59) profits."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Great 3Q Performance, But 4Q Risks Abound", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-17 ,"In the 3Q, the challenging dynamics of the 1H seemed to be a distant memory."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Great 3Q Performance, But 4Q Risks Abound", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-17 ,"While the cargo performance was still weaker y-o-y, SilkAir’s EBIT matched that of the previous year, Scoot delivered a small absolute improvement and the share of associate profits was actually higher y-o-y. However, the biggest star of the show was SIA mainline itself, delivering a staggering S$445m in EBIT (+21% y-o-y), its highest EBIT since Oct-Dec 2007, on the back of almost three consecutive years of RASK growth and a surprising 1.9% y-o-y fall in non-fuel unit cost (against 1H’s 0.9% y-o-y increase)."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Great 3Q Performance, But 4Q Risks Abound", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-17 ,"SIA attributed the latter to “initiatives arising from the transformation programme” and we will seek clarity at this morning’s analyst briefing to see if this non-fuel CASK drop is sustainable or not. With fuel costs making up 33% of SIA group’s airline operating costs, the 6% y-o-y drop in average post-hedge jet fuel price in the 3Q also made a big impact on the group’s performance; in contrast, the 1H post-hedge jet fuel price averaged 1% higher y-o-y."

See Singapore Airlines Target Price."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Full-year Profits To Be Hit By Wuhan Flu, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-05 ,"The first case of the coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province in Dec 2019, and this has spread rapidly since, particularly within China. In response to transmission fears, China banned group tours to foreign countries from 27 Jan, and Singapore banned anyone who has been to China in the past 14 days from entering the country effective 1 Feb, even on transit flights. Consequently, travel demand to China has collapsed, which hurts not just SIA group’s direct flights to China, but also travel from other parts of the world to China via the Singapore hub."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Full-year Profits To Be Hit By Wuhan Flu, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-05 ,"Anecdotally, we hear that even intra-ASEAN flight demand has been negatively affected. In short, we believe that SIA group will experience a large drop in travel demand, centered on its routes to China (plus HK and Macau), but also extending to many other parts of its route network."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Full-year Profits To Be Hit By Wuhan Flu, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-05 ,"SIA mainline has cut ASK capacity to China by 47% for the month of Feb, and even if we assume the Feb cuts will be extended for three months, it will only amount to 3% of SIA mainline’s quarterly ASK. In contrast, SIA mainline cut its ASK by 30% during the Apr-Jun 2003 quarter due to SARS."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Full-year Profits To Be Hit By Wuhan Flu, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-05 ,"SilkAir has cut its China ASK by 44% for Feb only, but so far, flights to other countries continue as normal, so the systemwide capacity cut is only 10% on a full quarter basis, which also looks low."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Full-year Profits To Be Hit By Wuhan Flu, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-05 ,"Meanwhile, Scoot has cut Feb-Mar capacity to China by 90%, excluding ad-hoc cuts for HK and Macau. This represents some 45% of Scoot’s medium/long-haul ASK; systemwide, the cuts represent 27% of Scoot’s total capacity since the short-haul flights remain intact."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Full-year Profits To Be Hit By Wuhan Flu, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2020-02-05 ,"We think that SIA mainline and SilkAir need to be more aggressive in their China cuts in extent and duration, and all three airlines need to consider cutting other flights in their wider non-China network, without which, its load factors may fall below the low of 57% seen during the Apr-Jun 2003 SARS quarter, and the negative earnings impact could be greater."

Singapore Travel and Hospitality - Sentiment Turns Cautious"
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,Tourism related stocks likely to be first hit.
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,Chinese government imposed travel ban.
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,Near-term volatility given uncertain outlook.
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,"We have seen some price weakness on the tourism-related stocks under our coverage this week. The decline could be largely due to the confirmation of human-to-human transmission of Wuhan coronavirus by the Chinese authorities and the rise in confirmed and suspicious cases of the coronavirus in China and globally. Based on the experiences during SARS crisis, should there be an outbreak of virus, tourism-related stocks such as travel and hospitality stocks are likely to be first hit as people tend to be cautious and delay their travel plans. As of 23 Jan 2020, there are 28 suspected cases seen in Singapore, and 1 confirmed case. The Chinese government announced the close-off of 8 cities in Hubei, a more proactive measure which was not taken during SARS crisis."
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,"We do see the potential outbreak of Wuhan coronavirus in Singapore, and expect to see near-term volatility should this happen, but believe that the market should be more resilient this time round given the SARS experience, and the authorities are also better prepared now. Should the travel ban imposed by Chinese government effectively control the spread of coronavirus, we would see the impact on the travel and hospitality sectors be shorter and lesser."
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,"We remain constructive on the Singapore Hospitality sector and SINGAPORE AIRLINES (SIA, SGX:C6L) over the long-term but remain cautious in the near-term. We also remain cautious on SATS (SGX:S58) given its weak cargo volumes and soft operating margins."
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,"We believe that the worries over a disease outbreak could weigh on travel demand as travelers would delay their travel plans, which could negatively affect airlines and related stocks. SIA and SATS’ share prices fell 1.9% and 3.6% respectively this week."
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,"If the coronavirus situation escalates further into a SARS-like situation, we believe that both companies’ operating performances are likely to come under pressure, weighing on profits. However, we are more positive on SIA over the longer-term given its growth outlook and relatively quick recovery during the SARS period. On the other hand, we remain cautious on SATS given its weak cargo volumes and soft operating margin."
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,"Recall that during the SARS outbreak from Nov 2002 to Aug 2003, visitor arrivals to Singapore fell 19.0% y-o-y from 7.6m in 2002 to 6.1m in 2003. The figure, however, quickly recovered and recorded a strong rebound of 36.0% y-o-y growth to 8.3m in 2004."
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,"During this period, SIA’s share price dropped 22.4% i.e. 5 months to the trough level in end of April and took another 1.5 months to recover back to pre-SARS level. In 1QFY03 which was SARS’ worst period, SIA reported a steep fall of 45.7% y-o-y in passenger carriage and 18.1 ppt decline in passenger load factor to 57.4%. SIA’s revenue dropped 35% and suffered a net loss of S$312m. Consequently, SIA cut its capacity by over 30%. Remarkably, SIA’s performance recovered fairly quickly once SARS was under control in the next quarter. In 2QFY03, SINGAPORE AIRLINES returned to profit. Net profit was 3.6% higher y-o-y. Passenger carriage also improved 80% q-o-q/-9% y-o-y while passenger load factor rebounded to 79.4, which was 1.3 ppt higher than the same period last year."
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,"As for SATS, 2002-2003 was also seen as a challenging period, which was severely affected by SARS and the weak macroeconomic environment. During this period, the share price dropped 15% i.e. 5 months to the trough level in mid-April and took another 1 month to recover back to its pre-SARS level. In FY03, SATS reported a dramatic drop in passengers handled (-15.9% y-o-y), meals catered (-11.1% y-o-y) and passengers served (-13.2% y-o-y). FY03 PATMI fell 11.6% and revenue declined 9.3%, partially aided by the strong recovery in traffic volume in the 2HFY03 (i.e Oct 2003-Mar 2004)."
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,"Hospitality REITS under our coverage experienced a decline in share prices this week e.g. -5.2% for FAR EAST HOSPITALITY TRUST (SGX:Q5T), -1.2% for CDL HOSPITALITY TRUSTS (SGX:J85) and -0.7% for ASCOTT RESIDENCE TRUST (SGX:HMN). The impact is limited so far with the exception of FAR EAST HOSPITALITY TRUST which was down 5.2% since 20 Jan, partly due to profit-taking. See S-REIT share price performance."
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,"Recall that during the worse period of the SARS outbreak in 2003, hotel occupancy plummeted 32.3 ppt to 42.4% in Q2, but soon recovered to 73.6% in Q3 after the situation improved and returned to the pre-SARS level of 77.0% in Q4. In terms of average room rate, it dropped 17% from S$126 in Oct 2002 (before the first case of SARS was reported in Nov 2002) to the lowest rate of S$105.2 in May 2003. In contrast to the quick rebound of visitor arrivals and occupancy, average room rate remained soft and took longer to recover to the pre-SARS rate."
Singapore Travel & Hospitality  - Sentiment Turns Cautious, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2020-01-24 ,"Looking at the sector as a whole, we still expect RevPAR pickup in 4Q19 but could potentially see a slower pickup or even negative RevPAR growth in 2020 should the travel ban fail to control the virus spread and the situation further escalates. However, given

a more resilient market this time with more advanced controls and experience from the SARS crisis,
benign room supply which is expected to grow at a lower CAGR of 1.3% for the next 4 years, and
a number of biennial events in Singapore this year, we remain constructive on the hospitality sector.

SARS – 11 Feb 2003"
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,"The SARS outbreak hit Singapore in Feb 2003 and claimed 33 lives. There was a knee-jerk sell-off across regional markets in the first week. However, one month after the SARS outbreak, most markets recovered, with the exception of Singapore and HK as the two countries took a while longer to recover due to high incidence of SARS cases."
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,"During the period of 18 Nov 2002 to 11 Mar 2003, MSCI Singapore dropped by 14%. From 10 Feb 2002, when media started to report death count, to the bottom of the market on 11 Mar 2003, Singapore market dropped by 6%. It fell by another 6% in the month from 25 Mar 2003 when Singapore reported its first SARS death case. As such, we estimate 6-12% downside risk for the index from the current levels."
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,"The biggest losers during the period from Nov 02 to Mar-03 were economic proxies such as developers (c.-19%) and banks (c.-22% y-o-y). SIA (SGX:C6L)’s share price fell 11% as the impact on its earnings was significant. Passenger traffic fell 35% y-o-y in 2QCY03 at the peak of the SARS crisis. Revenue fell 35% y-o-y to S$1.6bn, while it reported a net loss of S$312m (2QCY02: net profit of S$478m). However, by 2QCY04, SIA’s revenue rebounded by 65% (lower than passenger traffic growth of 97% y-o-y due to fare discounts and promotions), while it recovered into the black to report a net profit of S$255m (albeit lower than 2QCY02’s net profit). Overall tourist arrivals in Singapore declined 19% y-o-y with RevPAR down 17% y-o-y on the back of lower occupancy (-7.2% pts y-o-y) and average daily rate (-8.3% y-o-y). 2003 GDP growth came down to only 1.1% in 2003."
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,We would like to highlight that the market has become increasingly immune to event-driven shocks since 2003 as global governments are more prepared for public-health emergencies We would bargain hunt if the market weakens in the near term.

Avian Influenza 10 Jan 2006 and 1 April 2013"
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,"No cases were detected in Singapore, either in humans or poultry, but authorities remained vigilant on cases in Malaysia. Hospitals prepared H7N9 detection kits for potential cases. MSCI Singapore fell 14% from market peak to trough (3 May-14 June 2006) and was down 12% from 20 May - 24 June 2013 with no specific proxy sectors affected by the virus. We believe this was more due to the general weak sentiment in May."
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,"In 2003, the Singapore government rolled out a S$230m SARS relief package to help industries that had been more severely impacted, particularly the tourism and transport-related industries. Some measures included additional 30% rebates on airport landing fees, property tax relief for commercial properties such as hotels, shops and restaurants, as well as lower levy paid by employers on foreign workers they hired."
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,"Some of the efforts that are likely in the case of a prolonged outbreak are as follows:-

Stepping up health screening efforts at all international entry points
Imposing travel restrictions or advisories to and from countries that have influenza outbreaks
Issuing public advisory calling for targeted groups of people to get flu vaccinations
Increasing resources such as isolation facilities in hospitals and stockpiling medicine. Front-line healthcare workers in hospital and polyclinic settings will be given anti-viral prophylaxis for the duration of the pandemic.

Potential beneficiaries"
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,"The continued negative newsflow from the pandemic through Chinese New Year could be a catalyst for glove manufacturers such as Riverstone (SGX:AP4). Glove makers could see a rise in demand if the outbreak is prolonged and turns into a global pandemic. We witnessed this during the SARS outbreak in 2003 and avian flu in 2009. We estimate that global glove demand rose 10-13% in 2003 and 2009 (vs. 8% p.a. in 2000-18). Riverstone derives c.70% of its revenue from healthcare gloves. Currently, our base case assumptions factor in mid-teen volume growth for its healthcare gloves in FY20F, driven by enhanced awareness about hygiene and healthcare standards without any major virus outbreak."
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,"Healthcare providers and producers of medical gloves could be potential beneficiaries depending on the extent and length of the outbreak. During SARS, there was a positive share price reaction for Raffles Medical Group (SGX:BSL), as it was appointed by the immigration and checkpoint authorities (Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, and Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore) to conduct screening for fever and other symptoms at the air, land and sea border checkpoints. We also note that the official opening of Raffles Hospital in March 2002 could have been another share price driver. If the novel coronavirus continues to escalate and proves to be as severe as SARS, we think this could also benefit Raffles Medical Group in terms of redirection of patient footfall (from public hospitals), at both its Singapore and China hospitals."

Most vulnerable"
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,"The most vulnerable sectors are aviation, gaming, hospitality and consumer discretionary and ones with China exposure. For SIA (SGX:C6L), we expect a SARS-like impact on its passenger traffic and financial performance if the epidemic sweeps across Asia. SIA would not only see passenger load factors decline considerably, it would also have to slash airfares in order to incentivise passengers to fly again, while much of its operating costs are fixed in the short term. SIA can take mitigating actions like cancelling selected flight frequencies, and implementing a no-pay leave policy for staff or cutting staff allowances. In addition, SIA may be able to claim some assistance from the Singapore government and/or some incentives from airports, although these would only partially offset the negative impact on its bottomline, in our view. Unlike in 2003, when the SIA Group operated with only two brands – the flagship SIA full service carrier and its regional subsidiary SilkAir – the group now has a well-established low-cost brand named Scoot. As a result, we expect the SIA Group to be able to cope better with any epidemic-like contagion, as it can use low-cost carrier Scoot to drive traffic via fare discounts."
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,SATS (SGX:S58)’s inflight catering dropped 14% y-o-y and ground handling -10% y-o-y during the SARS outbreak on the back of cancellation and suspension of many flights during the first quarter after the outbreak.
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,"Hospitality names such as Far East Hospitality Trust (SGX:Q5T) could see the largest impact given its 41% of variable income exposure to Singapore. This is followed by CDL Hospitality Trusts (SGX:J85) which has 32% variable income exposure in Singapore. The impact on Ascott Residence Trust (SGX:HMN) should be less severe as 27% of its revenue is generated from China, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Based on our sensitivity analysis, a 1% pt decline in tourist arrivals in Singapore will reduce our industry RevPAR assumption by 1% pt, and a decline of 1% pt in RevPAR/RevPAU will reduce our Far East Hospitality Trust and CDL Hospitality Trusts’s FY20 DPU forecasts by 1% and 0.3% respectively. Consumer discretionary proxies such as city shopping malls and outlet malls are also at risk, including Starhill Global REIT (SGX:P40U) and SPH REIT (SGX:SK6U)."
Singapore Market Strategy  - Market May Catch A Flu If China Sneezes, CGS-CIMB , LIM Siew Khee , 2020-01-22 ,"Companies with significant China exposure may be impacted, including Dairy Farm International (SGX:D01). In 2003, Hong Kong’s retail sales value decline 2.3% y-o-y and tourist arrivals declined 6.2% y-o-y. Dairy Farm International also specifically mentioned that SARS had reduced sales at its Maxim's (restaurant associate earnings fell -30% y-o-y) and 7-11 stores. Given the heightened risks of further declines in retail sales and tourist arrivals amidst protests, Dairy Farm International's North Asia revenues and EBIT (65% of 1H19 revenue/~90% of 1H19 EBIT) as well as restaurant earnings (~20% of 1H19 net profit) could suffer a double whammy effect."

Meanwhile, we are not optimistic of swift compensation or return to service for B737 Max by 1H20."

"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Fuel Prices Not A Concern, But Bushfires In Australia Likely To Curb Traffic In 4QFY20", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | David Lee Gao Peng , 2020-01-10 ,SIA’s 3QFY20 load factor is likely to be strong (2M3QFY20: +2.3ppt) but 4QFY20’s traffic could be crimped by bushfires in Australia which accounts for 16% of SIA’s seat capacity and 18.3% of Scoot’s seat capacity. New South Wales has issued a travel advisory on 21 Dec 19. Travel demand could be substantially lower during the summer school holiday period which is the peak season for tourism.

However, SIA has an effective hedge of 77% on jet fuel at US$76/bbl for 2HFY20. Ytd (FY20), jet fuel has averaged US$77.8/bbl, while post 2QFY20 it has averaged US$76.5/bbl."

We have lowered our FY20 net profit forecast by 1.5% due mainly to a lowered traffic growth assumption for Scoot and SIA and higher losses from Virgin Australia, offset by lower financing costs arising from lower new debt assumptions. We recommend accumulating near S$8.60 and trimming at S$9.10 or higher."

Transport Sector 2020 Outlook & Strategy  - Decent Growth & Yields, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Suvro Sarkar  | Andy SIM  [CFA] , 2019-12-12 ,There were numerous privatisation offers (such as Boardroom and Millennium & Copthorne Hotels) as well as merger offers (OUE COMMERCIAL REIT (SGX:TS0U) with OUE HOSPITALITY TRUST; and FRASERS LOGISTICS & INDUSTRIAL TRUST (SGX:BUOU) with FRASERS COMMERCIAL TRUST (SGX:ND8U)) in 2019 and we are likely to see more of such corporate activities in 2020 as valuations remain conducive.

SIA Engineering (SIA EC) could be a prime privatisation or merger target, while Hutchison Port Holdings Trust may also come into play."
Transport Sector 2020 Outlook & Strategy  - Decent Growth & Yields, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] | Suvro Sarkar  | Andy SIM  [CFA] , 2019-12-12 ,"We believe that SIA Engineering could be privatised by its parent Singapore Airlines, which already has a c. 78% stake in the former, given that SIA Engineering has low float and trading liquidity and little need to tap the equity markets while giving Singapore Airlines time and room to restructure or streamline SIA Engineering as needed. A merger between SIA Engineering and ST Aerospace should also not be ruled out."

As such, an increase in fuel prices would pressure the margins of these two players, especially as both do not have significant pricing power. However, should oil prices fall significantly, this will help Singapore Airlines and Hutchison Port Holdings Trust."

a boost in maintenance work volumes due to delays in retiring older aircraft following the protracted global grounding of the B737 MAX aircraft.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Maintain HOLD with unchanged target price of S$10, still based on 0.9x P/BV, 1 s.d. below the mean since 2001, as economic headwinds begin to blow in."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"SIA group’s 3-year transformation plan since 2017 has had a major impact on SIA mainline, the flagship full-service carrier (FSC) in the group, with the revenue management system helping to push up its local currency yields by 3.6% y-o-y during 1HFY20, although S$ appreciation against major revenue currencies reduced the yield upside to only 1% y-o-y."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,Non-stop US flights have helped to lift premium demand on connecting short-haul sectors such as India/Indonesia to Singapore.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Passenger load factors reached an all-time high of 85.9% for SIA mainline, as the new revenue management system prescribed a successful strategy of lowering yields in exchange for even higher traffic, with the net result of higher overall revenue per unit of capacity."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"On the product front, SIA mainline will introduce a new generation of cabin products once the 777X begins delivery in 2022F (to replace the 777-300ERs), while SilkAir will also retrofit its existing 737-800NGs (and eventually its MAX 8s) with a new short-haul product."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"SilkAir’s 6 x 737 MAX 8 planes were grounded since Mar 2019, while Scoot now has two 787-9s grounded due to TRENT 1000 engine issues. These issues have affected aircraft productivity and increased both airlines’ unit costs. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"The US/EU aviation regulators will likely permit the reactivation of commercial flights for the MAX 8s from Dec/Jan, to be followed in due course by Asian regulators. After retraining its pilots on the MCAS system, SilkAir may be able to reactivate its MAX 8 fleet sometime next year, in our view."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Meanwhile, one of Scoot’s grounded 787-9s has just been fitted with new engines, while the other plane should be fitted in six months’ time."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Separately, while Scoot has had teething issues after taking over several routes from SilkAir, we believe that they will be resolved in time, helping Scoot boost its yields."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"While SIA group’s structural costs have risen, its new A350/787 fleet has helped improve fuel efficiency by almost 30% when compared to legacy models. It is also continuing to develop deep commercial airline partnerships, with the latest being with Malaysia Airlines. Vistara continues to push ahead with its international route expansion, and took advantage of Jet Airways’ demise in several ways, while new management at Virgin Australia can hopefully help to address its ongoing losses."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"SIA group is also pushing ahead to build ancillary businesses like KrisShop and KrisFlyer. Finally, SIA is pushing to develop the NDC platform for ticket sales that promises to reduce distribution costs."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Local fares across the SIA mainline network have improved by 3.6% y-o-y for 1HFY20, but after accounting for S$-appreciation against revenue currencies (such as the Australian dollar, euro and Chinese renminbi), SIA mainline’s yields were ‘only’ 1% higher y-o-y."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"The strong yield performance was due to the following reasons.

The new revenue management system that was put in place in 2017, has worked well to price fares dynamically at levels that customers would be willing to accept.
Strong premium travel demand has more than offset weaker economy class yields.
Non-stop direct US flights have helped improve the load factors of the premium cabins on short-haul flights from India-Singapore and Indonesia- Singapore, and to the extent that short-haul flights have higher yield, the overall SIA yield also rises. Furthermore, the non-stop US flights on the A350-900ULR have a higher premium content, as there are no economy class seats, only business and premium economy seats.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"SIA disclosed that since the launch of the direct Singapore-US flights, SIA’s weekly frequencies to the US have increased by 16 flights, passengers to the US have increased 35%, and SIA’s market share from Singapore to the US has risen by 21% pts."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Also, SIA gained market share on regional flows to the US (via Singapore). For instance, SIA’s market share on flows from Southeast Asia (ex- Singapore) to the US rose by 1% pt, market share from India to the US West Coast rose 2% pts, and market share from Southwest Pacific (Australia and New Zealand) to the US East Coast rose 1% pt."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"SIA said that it was still seeing healthy premium bookings across all the major markets, especially for US long-haul, non-stop flights. The IT and professional services sectors are still doing well, even though the finance sector may be a bit muted. While the manufacturing sector and the physical movement of goods may be affected by trade wars, the services industries are still doing well and are helping to driving premium passenger traffic demand."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"SIA mainline will introduce its 777X replacement for its 777-300ERs in 2022F, with cabin-leading products, hence keeping its tight grasp on product quality and rankings among premium travellers."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"SIA mainline’s passenger load factor (PLF) hit a historic high of 85.9% in 2QFY20F, which is another significant achievement. For its economy class cabins, SIA mainline has been willing to price competitively to build load factors, as lower yields have resulted in higher overall revenues since passenger demand has increased by more than the decline in yields."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"On the other hand, there is an inverse correlation between SIA’s net promoter score (loyalty of its customers) against the PLF, hence SIA needs to balance these two objectives."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"SilkAir has not been doing too well lately because of the issues surrounding the grounding of its 6 x 737 MAX 8s. The SIA group saw ‘other passenger revenue’ decline in 1HFY20 due to lower charter flights revenue, mainly because SilkAir had no excess aircraft to lease out to third-party operators given that its 6 x 737 MAX 8s have been grounded."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Also, SilkAir continues to incur maintenance costs and depreciation costs for the 737 MAX 8 planes, which are currently parked in the Australian desert in Alice Springs. The planes were flown there in October because the humid climate in Singapore made it difficult to maintain."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"The reactivation of the 737 MAX 8s will depend on regulatory approval in Asia, not just the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US. The FAA will likely allow the 737 MAX 8 to resume flying in December 2019, and the European regulators have agreed on a preliminary basis to allow reactivation in January 2020. The reactivation of SilkAir’s 737 MAX 8 fleet will likely depend on their recertification by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and other regional aviation regulators in Asia and Australia which could take several months. In addition, it may also take a number of months to train SilkAir’s pilots to operate the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which is at the heart of the issue behind the two 737 MAX 8 plane crashes. In our view, it may be possible for SilkAir to reactivate its 6 x 737 MAX 8 planes sometime during 2020F if all goes well on the regulatory front."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"On a separate note, SilkAir is finalising upgrading of seats on its 737-800NG planes to the new short-haul product that was actually intended to be fitted on the currently-grounded 737 MAX 8 fleet. Apart from the 6 x 737 MAX 8 planes that had already been delivered, SilkAir also has a further 31 orders for the aircraft type. The current MAX 8 product has recliner business-class seats and no seatback In-Flight Entertainment (IFE). SilkAir had originally intended to retrofit all of its existing MAX 8 planes with lie-flat business-class seats and seatback IFE on all seats, and equip all the new MAX 8 deliveries with the same product, so as to standardise the product with SIA mainline prior to a full merger of the two brands. The MAX 8 planes would then be the cornerstone SilkAir product, with SilkAir planning to transfer 14 x 737-800NGs to Scoot (which will be retrofitted to an LCC product) and to retire the remaining 3 x 737-800NGs."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"However, the subsequent issues with the MAX 8 planes put paid to SilkAir’s original plans, such that the 14 x 737-800NGs will no longer be transferred to Scoot, but will instead be retained by SilkAir. Because the merger with SIA mainline is still on the cards, SilkAir will proceed to retrofit the 737-800NGs with the new short-haul product that was originally intended for the MAX 8s. When the MAX 8s are reinstated to full service, SilkAir will presumably retrofit those as well. The timeline for the 14 x 737-800NG product retrofit was not disclosed, but we expect these to be done on a progressive basis over the next 1-2 years."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,Scoot had three major issues in the past six months or more which had impacted its profitability. The first issue has been the technical problems with the TRENT 1000 engines that are fitted on its 10 x 787-9 aircraft. The second issue lies with the teething problems faced when it started taking over several SilkAir routes. And the final issue is with slowing outbound Chinese travel demand and the heightened competition with the Chinese carriers which had deployed more capacity to Southeast Asia.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"In relation to the first issue, Scoot has had two ‘gliders’ for the past two months, i.e. 787-9s that have had their TRENT 1000 engines removed to enable a technical fix by Rolls-Royce. The shortfall in capacity caused lengthy flight delays in late-2018 when technical problems affected other planes, causing serious passenger dissatisfaction which was played up in the media and caused Singapore-origin bookings to fall. In response to these problems, Scoot decided to increase the number of spare planes and to reduce the aircraft utilisation from 13+ hours a day to 11+ hours, down 15%. This caused non-fuel unit costs to rise due to the lower ASK production and fleet inefficiency. However, Scoot saw this move as necessary to restore passenger confidence."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"The technical issues surrounding the TRENT 1000 engines are in the process of achieving a near-term resolution. One of the two ‘gliders’ has just been re-fitted with engines. The second aircraft will still need a further six months to return to service. However, as the engines age, Scoot has to do more inspections for the blades and the drums, which can be time consuming. A more permanent resolution will be available when Rolls-Royce readies newly-certified parts to be installed on the fleet of 10 x TRENT 1000 engines (Scoot has 10 x 787-9 aircraft in its fleet); however, this may not be available so quickly and Scoot will have to remain on guard for any technical issues that may arise in the future. Thankfully, Scoot’s fleet of 10 x 787-8s are not affected as they are fitted with different engines."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"In terms of the second issue, Scoot is in the process of taking over the SilkAir routes, having already taken over seven routes up to 30 September 2019, with another 10 route transfers to be completed by June 2020. However, Scoot has had some teething issues when taking over the routes. Scoot had issues building demand for all the new routes taken over from SilkAir, as Scoot’s aircraft seat capacity is larger and Scoot needed to discount fares to build demand. Scoot deployed larger-capacity narrow-bodies on these ex-SilkAir routes, with 180 all-economy class seats on the A320s, against SilkAir’s 150- seat A320s or 162-seat 737-800NGs. The larger seat capacity required Scoot to discount its prices in order to clear the seat inventory."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Separately, Scoot also needed to remarket the flights as LCC flights instead of full-service carrier (FSC) flights, working with different sales agents as that of SilkAir’s, using different ground handlers, and other kinds of new infrastructure needs that have been established by Scoot."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"In terms of the third issue, while there has been no incremental worsening in the level of competition with Chinese carriers, the capacity that the latter has deployed to Southeast Asia remains intact, and the market still needs time to absorb the capacity. The slowdown in Chinese outbound travel due to the weaker renminbi and weaker economic growth has not helped."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"SIA said that the China-US and Europe-Asia cargo markets have become weaker for its cargo business in recent months. SIA retains its bearish view on the airfreight markets, saying that it does not see signs of an upturn, and excess capacity that had been in place since the airfreight boom in 2017-18 is still in place and is now placing pressure on cargo yields."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"The SIA group has incurred higher staff costs due to headcount increase, higher pay/allowance rates for cabin crew and pilots, higher crew allowances due to non-stop services to the US, increased flying hours, and higher provisions for bonuses due to the higher PLF."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"The SIA group has taken onto its balance sheet 26 more planes y-o-y, hence causing depreciation expense to rise, although this has been mitigated by the return of 10 planes to lessors, with a net fleet increase of 16 planes."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"SIA has raised more borrowings to finance aircraft purchases, resulting in higher interest costs. Interest and depreciation costs also rose due to IFRS 16 implementation from 1 April 2019, which saw a reallocation of operating lease charges into their respective interest and depreciation components."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Group sales costs rose 14.8% due to higher commissions, advertising, fees, transaction costs paid to various booking engines, as building business for the future. SIA has pushed sales by incentivising agents through higher commission rates. Advertising spend has increased in relation to new routes such as Busan and Seattle."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Meanwhile, SIA has “struggled” with suppliers in monopoly positions such as payment gateways, credit card companies, where their rates are being raised."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,The structurally-higher non-fuel costs enumerated above have been partially offset by an increase in fuel efficiency as a result of SIA group’s newest-technology planes.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"SIA mainline maintains deep commercial partnerships with Virgin Australia, Air New Zealand, Lufthansa, and SAS, with the newest addition being Malaysia Airlines (MAS)."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"The SIA group and MAS announced a commercial tie-up on 30 October 2019, which involves SIA mainline, SilkAir, Scoot, MAS and Firefly (MAS’s turboprop operator). The tie-up requires regulatory approvals from the competition authorities in both Malaysia and Singapore."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"The commercial tie-up involves the following:

On all flights between Malaysia and Singapore, SIA group and MAS group will revenue share, coordinate their flight schedules, and offer “joint fare products”.
MAS will codeshare on SIA group’s flights to Malaysia, Europe and South Africa, and other international destinations to be introduced in the future. This is likely to include SIA mainline/SilkAir’s flights to Malaysia, as well as Scoot’s flights between Singapore and seven destinations in Malaysia (Ipoh, Kota Bahru, KL, Kuantan, Kuching, Langkawi and Penang).
Codesharing of SIA mainline/SilkAir/Scoot on MAS/Firefly domestic flights (SIA mainline/SilkAir already places its code on international flights between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching), which will expand SIA group’s coverage of Malaysian destinations from four to 16 cities (Alor Setar, Johor Bahru, Kota Bahru, Kuala Terengganu, Kuantan, Langkawi, Bintulu, Labuan, Miri, Sandakan, Sibu, and Tawau, in addition to Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching.
SIA group and MAS group will also explore potential tie-up of their frequent flier programmes, KrisFlyer and Enrich.
Joint marketing to promote tourism to Malaysia, by allowing passengers arriving in Singapore to travel to multiple cities in Malaysia on a single ‘airpass’ ticket.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"The rationale for MAS to enter into this commercial partnership is as follows:

Joint schedule coordination and revenue sharing of all flights between Singapore and Malaysia will benefit MAS group and SIA group as the market is very competitive with AirAsia operating multiple daily frequencies. AirAsia X also recently deployed widebody A330s on the KL-Singapore route, increasing LCC capacity on the route. Joint schedule coordination means that te flights between Singapore and Malaysia are spaced out across the day, rather than having several flights lumped together in a narrow time corridor. This may help MAS group and SIA group to increase their load factors.
MAS has a very limited network outside of the Asia-Pacific region after having cut most of its European, Middle Eastern, and African flights in 2016 or earlier. MAS has previously tied up with Emirates to provide connectivity to Europe, Middle East and Africa, but it is very likely that many Malaysians rather book directly with Emirates or other Gulf carriers, rather than book through MAS. As a result, we think that MAS is not extracting much value from its Emirates tie-up, leading MAS to explore another alternative through the SIA group.
Allowing SIA group to codeshare on 12 domestic flights operated by MAS/Firefly in Malaysia is essentially asking SIA group to be the marketing agent for these domestic flights. This will help MAS because SIA group has vast global reach.

Not many Malaysians travel to South Africa, so the incremental passenger contribution to the SIA network is minimal. As for Europe, Malaysians tend to prefer flights by Gulf carriers like Emirates, Etihad or Qatar, because travelling south to the Singapore hub is a diversion before backtracking to the north.
SIA group’s network in Asia-Pacific and Australia has not been included in the new codesharing arrangement, because MAS already has a good network within these geographies.
Strangely, SIA mainline’s direct flights to the US are also not included in the new codesharing arrangement, at least for now. This is potentially one of the areas which SIA group will include in the future expansion of codesharing. Malaysians flying to the US have to take one-stop flights via hubs in North Asian, Middle Eastern, or Europe, so a one-stop in Singapore makes the SIA one-stop offering to the US no worse off than other options available to Malaysians.
Finally, we do not think that codeshare domestic flights by MAS to the 12 new Malaysian cities will see much demand among SIA’s customers, because these are secondary or tertiary cities.

Malaysians flying to the US have to take one-stop flights via hubs in North Asian, Middle Eastern, or Europe, so a one-stop in Singapore makes the SIA one-stop offering to the US no worse off than other options available to Malaysians."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Finally, we do not think that codeshare domestic flights by MAS to the 12 new Malaysian cities will see much demand among SIA’s customers, because these are secondary or tertiary cities."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"In conclusion, we think that the new SIA-MAS commercial agreement is beneficial in terms of coordinating schedules and sharing revenues for flights for the full-service carriers between Singapore and KL/Penang/KK/Kuching. This will reduce flight overlap, spread out flights throughout the day, and increase load factors for specific flights for both airlines. This will also help the FSCs improve their fleet deployment efficiencies in an environment where LCCs are constantly keeping fares low. However, we think that the bigger beneficiary will be MAS group, because it can ride on SIA/SilkAir’s superior product."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"On the other hand, SIA/SilkAir customers may see service deterioration if they are forced to sit in an MAS/Firefly plane in that specific travel time slot. Overall, we do not expect the benefits to be significant to either MAS group or SIA group."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Vistara’s 1HFY20 net losses rose slightly vs. 1HFY19, as it had recruited 500 staff from Jet Airways, took over Jet Airways’ 9 x B737-800NG, increased its domestic routes network, and launched international flights. This was partially offset by higher domestic yields after the demise of Jet Airways from April 2019. Vistara currently flies to 34 destinations, including three international routes (Singapore, Bangkok and Dubai) with Colombo starting soon. Vistara will have 42 aircraft by March 2020F (vs. 22 planes in March 2019), with 2 x 787-9s, 6 x A320neos and 1 x A321neo to be delivered soon."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Virgin Australia continues to make losses in its international business and on its Tigerair Australia business, although its domestic business is profitable (which is not surprising given that the domestic market is a duopoly with Qantas). SIA has a 20% equity stake in Virgin Australia, so it continues to account for its share of Virgin Australia’s losses. Nevertheless, Virgin Australia has a new CEO and management team, and which will need some time to tackle the underlying issues. In the meantime, SIA continues to benefit from the flow of traffic feed from the partnership with Virgin Australia, and can also offer SIA’s passengers more destinations in Australia through the code sharing arrangement."

KrisFlyer"
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"The KrisFlyer membership has risen to over 4m in FY19, and it delivered 18% y-o-y growth in revenue to over S$700m in FY19, with a similar pace of growth expected for FY20F. Over 70% of this revenue was generated from over 200 partners. SIA is targeting to keep growing KrisFlyer by tying up more merchants. The KrisPay platform has also been introduced to enable KrisFlyer members to utilise their frequent flyer miles to redeem everyday items."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"In general, frequent flier programmes earn revenue by charging merchants for the points awarded to the latter’s customers. These merchants offer KrisFlyer miles to their customers in exchange for their patronage, and part of the revenue earned by the merchants is used to pay for the KrisFlyer points that are awarded to those merchants’ customers. KrisFlyer records the cash received from the merchants as unearned revenue (booked in the balance sheet as a liability), and once the points are used to redeem SIA flights or other goods/services, KrisFlyer will derecognise the unearned revenue and transfer the equivalent sum to revenue. KrisFlyer then pays the airline or the merchants for the cost of the flight or the goods/services purchased from the points, and the difference is recognised as profits."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,SIA spoke in more detail about its adoption of the New Distribution Capability (NDC) and how it may help to reduce its distribution costs.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Currently, there are only 4 Global Distribution Systems (GDS) globally, and some of them are specific to markets in China and Japan. Airlines rely on GDSs to distribute their seat inventory to travel agents around the world, and GDSs control the visibility of seat inventory to potential air travellers."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"In order to gain more control over sales and to increase personalisation of the offers to passengers, SIA is pushing a new set of standards and infrastructure which IATA has developed, called NDC. SIA targets to have 20% of its business booked through NDC in the next 12 months. SIA says that it is still in the very early stages of NDC implementation, but NDC may eventually lower unit distribution costs for SIA, and drive more relevant content to passengers."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"Traditional GDS systems offer seat bookings on specific flights for travel agents, but cannot offer other ancillary services like seat selection, meal bookings, etc. On the other hand, airline websites can offer the entire suite of ancillary services. On behalf of their customers, travel agents are asking for more features, and GDSs have to respond by linking their systems to airlines’ NDC systems."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"The link is enabled by an interface called KrisConnect, which is an Application Programming Interface (API) that acts as an enabler to link SIA’s NDC to various GDS systems. In this way, the travel agents have access not just to seats but also to the ancillary services, and GDSs can enhance their offerings to the travel agents. The end result is for SIA to ultimately negotiate down the GDS booking fees."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"We maintain our HOLD recommendation, with an unchanged target price of S$10, still pegged to P/BV of 0.9x (1 s.d. below mean). With the cargo business remaining weak, there is a risk that premium passenger demand that has underpinned SIA’s profitability so far this year will eventually come under some pressure. See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,"There is a historical lagged correlation between cargo demand and the demand for premium-cabin and business-related travel, which poses a downside risk."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Managing The Airline Portfolio Deftly, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2019-11-11 ,Upside risks include the potential for SilkAir to rethink its long-term capacity growth by renegotiating the 737 MAX 8 orders with Boeing.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Weak Cargo; Strong Passenger Traffic, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2019-11-07 ,"Net profit grew 68% y-o-y to S$94.5m, as associates and joint ventures’ showed improvement in results (mainly from Virgin Australia) with losses narrowed from S$117.6m to S$39.8m in 2QFY20. The growth was partially offset by higher net finance charges (+1.6% y-o-y), due to the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases and additional financing for fleet renewal and expansion."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Weak Cargo; Strong Passenger Traffic, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2019-11-07 ,"Passenger growth was strong in 2QFY20 across all airlines, with record 2Q and 1HFY20 pax load factor (PLF). Operating performances of the airlines were generally helped by higher traffic growth but dragged by higher expenditures (largely from non-fuel costs), which in turn led to operating loss of S$3m (flat y-o-y) and S$36m (vs S$11m in 2QFY19) for SilkAir and Scoot respectively, as well as lower operating profit (-1.7% y-o-y ) for SIA parent airline."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Weak Cargo; Strong Passenger Traffic, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2019-11-07 ,"Singapore Airlines parent airline and SilkAir saw improvements in RASK in 1HFY20, showing that the recovery is on track. SilkAir was adversely affected by the transfer of routes to Scoot as well as the 737 Max grounding, yet it managed to drive growth in revenue, boosted by traffic growth of 3.1%."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Weak Cargo; Strong Passenger Traffic, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2019-11-07 ,Scoot’s traffic grew more rapidly at 7% as it was able to capture more routes from SilkAir. Management noted the challenges to build the brand name in new routes and the lingering issues with SilkAir’s Rolls-Royce engines but believed that they are transitional issues.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Weak Cargo; Strong Passenger Traffic, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2019-11-07 ,"Passenger bookings in the coming months remain healthy and are expected to be stronger y-o-y, particularly driven by the long-haul flights to US. We expect the flown revenue to remain the key growth driver and higher revenue contribution from KrisShop in 2HFY20. However, cargo revenue remains a concern and rising expenditure may be a short-term drag, given Singapore Airlines’s strategy to grow in capacity with 159 outstanding aircraft deliveries to support fleet renewal and expansion."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Weak Cargo; Strong Passenger Traffic, OCBC Investment , Chu Peng , 2019-11-07 ,"Nonetheless, we believe that this is beneficial to the Group in the long run.

SINGAPORE AIRLINES (SIA, SGX:C6L)’s 2QFY20 net profit at S$94.5m was sharply below our estimate. We had expected parent airline’s operating profit to rise 36% y-o-y but it declined 1.7% y-o-y in the quarter due to a steep 8.4% y-o-y decline in cargo yield. Scoot’s losses also rose more than three-fold amid a 7% y-o-y increase in opex for the period. However, the bulk of the earnings estimate variance was due to continued associate losses. SIA made a S$116m provision for Virgin Australia (VA) in the prior quarter. Excluding SIA Engineering (SGX:S59)’s consolidated associate, associate loss would have been S$67.5m, which implies continued losses at VA, Vistara or NokScoot.

In 2QFY20, cargo revenue declined by S$93m vs 1QFY20’s S$44.6m decline, impacting parent airline’s profitability. Going forward, SIA expects yields to remain depressed due to excess capacity and it will cut cargo capacity to - 1% from prior guidance of 2-3% growth."

The stock is trading at 0.9x FY20 P/BV, which we see as attractive with ROE projected to rebound to 6.8% by FY21."

Silkair’s losses stayed flat at S$3m. Finance costs rose by 155% to S$46m on adoption of IFRS 16 lease accounting and higher debt borrowings while lower losses at associates and joint ventures of S$40m vs S$118m a year ago helped pretax earnings to improve by 32% y-o-y to S$138m."

"Singapore Airlines  - Okay For Now, But Darker Clouds On The Horizon", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-08-01 ,"We noted in our results report that SIA was not a compelling investment case at Wednesday’s closing price of S$9.67, but after the sell-off today, SIA is once again closing in on its trough P/BV valuation of 0.8x, or S$8.93, which is just 3% lower than the current SIA share price. Nevertheless, we are not upgrading our call to an Add, because the earnings momentum for SIA looks set to decelerate, given the ongoing cargo demand and yield weakness, and an expected delayed flow-through in the future to premium demand and yields."
"Singapore Airlines  - Okay For Now, But Darker Clouds On The Horizon", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-08-01 ,"SIA told analysts that conditions were hunky-dory for the mainline passenger carrier to-date, with premium demand and yields holding up, although economy class yields were under a bit of competitive pressure. Looking three months forward, no weakness has been detected, contrary to Cathay Pacific’s warnings of substantial pressure on long-haul passenger yields in the coming months. However, SIA is worried about the weakening global economic momentum indicators, which had preceded a weakening of business travel demand and yields in the past."
"Singapore Airlines  - Okay For Now, But Darker Clouds On The Horizon", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-08-01 ,"SIA is bearish on the outlook for its cargo business, as the US-China trade war has caused demand to fall while freighter capacity put in place during the cargo boom years of 2017-18 have remained in place, causing oversupply and continuing to put pressure on cargo yields."
"Singapore Airlines  - Okay For Now, But Darker Clouds On The Horizon", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-08-01 ,"SilkAir’s grounding of its six 737 MAX 8 planes caused non-fuel operating costs to escalate, as it continues to depreciate the planes while generating no revenue from them. With multiple regulatory hurdles to clear, SilkAir was unsure when the planes could be reactivated, which means SilkAir’s financial performance might be lacklustre for a while yet."
"Singapore Airlines  - Okay For Now, But Darker Clouds On The Horizon", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-08-01 ,"Meanwhile, Scoot continues to face issues with the reliability of the Rolls-Royce TRENT 1000 engines powering its 787-9 fleet, which had caused lengthy flight delays in the last few months of 2018 and a fall-off at its Singapore point-of-sale. As a result, Scoot has been forced to curtail its aircraft utilisation by 15% or two hours a day, and set aside more spare aircraft, which impacted its planned capacity expansion."
"Singapore Airlines  - Okay For Now, But Darker Clouds On The Horizon", CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-08-01 ,"Once the technical issues on the MAX 8 and TRENT 1000 engines are resolved, SilkAir and Scoot will be achieve their true long-term potential."

Taking that aside, last quarter’s EBIT was flattish y-o-y, with an operating profit improvement at

SIA mainline’s passenger business and at

Singapore Airlines  - Share Price Constrained By Mixed Outlook, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI  | , 2019-08-01 ,"SilkAir grounded its fleet of six 737 MAX 8 planes on 12 Mar 2019, and 1QFY20 reflected the first full quarter of that impact with an EBIT loss of S$16m, vs. breakeven last year. Costs related to the grounding and loss of revenue from the subsequent reduction of capacity contributed the majority of the loss. This was partly compensated by SilkAir’s third-consecutive quarter of y-o-y RASK increase as passenger demand and loads responded positively to lower yields. The efforts to improve RASK are important because SilkAir had over-expanded by growing ASK capacity 36% over the past four years, which led to a 15% RASK decline over that same period."
Singapore Airlines  - Share Price Constrained By Mixed Outlook, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI  | , 2019-08-01 ,"During our recent marketing trip to Singapore, many investors asked if there was a case to accumulate SIA shares. At its recent low of S$9.06 on 4 Jun, SIA was certainly very attractive, trading at its trough valuation of 0.8x P/BV, but at the current share price of S$9.67, the upside is no longer so compelling, in our view. See SIA share price history."
Singapore Airlines  - Share Price Constrained By Mixed Outlook, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI  | , 2019-08-01 ,Cathay Pacific recently warned of “intense market competition” that “continued to exert pressure on yield” especially on long-haul flights.

Singapore Airlines  - Share Price Constrained By Mixed Outlook, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI  | , 2019-08-01 ,"Our HOLD call is premised on weakening global GDP growth and higher tariffs that are now beleaguering the US-China trade and have been negatively affecting SIA’s airfreight demand and yield since late-CY18. There is a historical lagged correlation between cargo demand and demand for premium-cabin and business-related travel, which pose a downside risk."
Singapore Airlines  - Share Price Constrained By Mixed Outlook, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI  | , 2019-08-01 ,Upside risks include the potential for SilkAir to rethink its long-term capacity growth by renegotiating the 737 MAX 8 orders with Boeing.

Below the EBIT line, higher finance charges and losses from associates of S$30m (versus a gain of S$1.3m a year ago), due to higher estimated losses from Virgin Australia, caused net earnings to decline by 20% y-o-y to S$111m."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Strong Pax Traffic But Cargo Traffic Declines For 9 Straight Months, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith , 2019-06-19 ,"The 3.2% y-o-y decline in cargo traffic in May was an improvement from April’s 7.5% y-o-y decline. Singapore Airlines’s May data stands in contrast to the 15.9% y-o-y decline in NODX and a 31.4% decline in electronics exports over the same period. However, the discrepancy was due to the fact that Singapore Airlines’s cargo traffic is on a tonne-km basis and includes imports, while exports data are in dollar terms. Also, air cargo traffic is highly weighted towards electronics exports, which are relatively lighter and hence the decline in tonnage terms might not be significant."

These technical issues have caused a series of problems to the SIA group.

First, the groundings caused scheduling headaches and customer satisfaction issues which need to be handled delicately.
Second, the groundings may result in rectification costs (which may be compensated by the manufacturers), and the costs of taking on more aircraft leases to meet capacity needs.
Last, near-term capacity expansion plans have been affected, with the group’s ASK capacity growth plan cut slightly to 6% in FY20F (from 6.4% in FY3/19).

Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"We think SilkAir will attempt to build in a good time buffer to make sure that all issues are fully resolved before delivery resumes. Also, the remaining MAX 8 orders were to have been fully delivered over five years from CY19- 23F, but SilkAir may try to extend the deliveries over a longer period of time, in order to temper its capacity growth in view of current regional overcapacity."

Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"Based on the explanation from SIA, we do not believe that this is reflective of underlying weakness in the demand environment.

Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"Meanwhile, for March 2019, SIA said that the y-o-y drop in RASK was due to the shift in Easter from end- March 2018 to mid-April 2019. However, SIA did say that the competition in the marketplace was becoming more intense. Also, SIA noted in its recent results release that it has continued to see “growth in forward passenger bookings” and “robust premium-cabin demand”."
Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"The revenue per unit of Available Seat Kilometre (RASK) capacity for the low-cost carrier (LCC) business under Scoot has fallen for two-consecutive quarters due to excessive capacity expansion and the consequent fall in passenger load factors, but also because of the expansion of state-owned Chinese carriers into Southeast Asia (in particular to Singapore) that have caused aggressive price competition."
Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"The outlook on Scoot’s RASK will likely continue to be weak for the rest of FY20F, in our view, simply because of the high-base effect, because the competition’s capacity expansion only began in earnest from the quarter ended December 2018, and also because Chinese outbound travel to Southeast Asia has slowed materially in recent months."
Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"However, there is potential for improvement in FY20F, as Scoot terminated poorly-performing flights to Dhaka, Dalian and Honolulu in FY19, and will be terminating loss-making flights to Lucknow and Kalibo from end-June 2019F, to Quanzhou from August, and to Male from October."

With Scoot, however, these routes are a golden opportunity for growth."
Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"Scoot would not have to terminate the above routes if the planned transfers of 14 x 737-800 planes from SilkAir to Scoot take place over the next 12 months or so, but with the groundings of SilkAir’s fleet of 6 x 737 MAX 8 planes, SilkAir will now keep the 737-800 planes in its fleet. As such, the ASK capacity growth for Scoot was guided by management to be 7% in FY20F, a marked slowdown from the 15.1% growth seen in FY19."
Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"Hence, the issues surrounding the 737 MAX 8 planes in SilkAir’s fleet, as well as those on order, have forced Scoot to dial back its growth plans and to exercise greater selectivity on the routes that it chooses to serve – eliminating loss-making routes and focusing on those that make the most commercial sense, including the regional routes to be taken over from SilkAir. This should be positive for Scoot’s financial performance, in our view."
Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"Over the next two years, Scoot will need to lease in additional planes, perhaps 10-12 A320s, in place of the 14 x 737-800s that were originally scheduled for transfer from SilkAir to Scoot. Also, Scoot is looking at extending 4-6 aircraft leases, both narrow-and wide-bodied planes. This is because Scoot is still going to take over regional routes from SilkAir despite not getting any aircraft transferred from SilkAir."

Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"On a monthly basis, RAFTK had been higher y-o-y until October 2018, before being flat on a y-o-y basis in November 2018, and then falling y-o-y from December 2018 onwards, with the February 2019 RAFTK falling by as much as 10.9% y-o-y. During 2018, many importers and exporters frontloaded cargo volumes prior to the implementation of tariffs, but with US businesses now well stocked, it was not surprising that airfreight demand, and consequently cargo yields and RAFTK, fell."
Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"The recent escalation in the tariff rates for the US-China trade, and the global slowdown in GDP growth, portend continued airfreight weakness for the rest of CY19F, in our view."
Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"Our HOLD call is premised on weakening global GDP growth and higher tariffs that are now beleaguering the US-China trade and that is already negatively affecting SIA’s airfreight demand and yield since late-CY18. Although in “the months ahead”, SIA continues to see “growth in forward passenger bookings” and “robust premium-cabin demand”, there is a historical lagged correlation between cargo demand and demand for premium-cabin and business-related travel, which pose a downside risk."
Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,Upside risks include the potential for SilkAir to rethink its long-term capacity growth by renegotiating the 737 MAX 8 orders with Boeing.

Singapore Airlines  - Opportunistically Using Disruptions For Good, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-05-20 ,"For FY20F, SIA has hedged 69% of its fuel needs at an average strike price of c.US$75/bbl of jet fuel, so downside protection is reasonably good.

Industrial Sector Outlook  - On A Recovery Path, Maybank Kim Eng , Neel Sinha  | Lai Gene Lih , 2019-04-17 ,"The outlook for the aerospace MRO industry looks a lot brighter for 2019-2021 from a combination of factors:

a tight freighter market and availability of mid-life and older generation aircraft triggering passenger-to freighter conversion work;
some industry capacity rationalisation;
strong growth in the global commercial aircraft fleet with deliveries from OEMs Airbus and Boeing at record levels of over 1,500 annually; and
investment in secondary and tertiary cites airport infrastructure in APAC combined with growth in LCC fleets expanding flight frequency and the roster of destinations. This bodes well for catering, ground handling, cargo management, refueling, aircraft conversions and other peripheral aviation services.

On the flipside, MRO shops exposed largely to line maintenance of passenger fleets have to contend with structural headwinds of longer maintenance cycles of newer aircraft."

Singapore Airlines  - B737 MAX Grounding Not Significant To SIA, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-03-18 ,An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight crashed on 10 Mar and similarities with a Lion Air crash of the same model five months previously have led aviation regulators across the world to ground the MAX 8/9 planes.
Singapore Airlines  - B737 MAX Grounding Not Significant To SIA, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-03-18 ,"On 12 Mar, SilkAir grounded its 6 x Boeing MAX 8 planes. Boeing plans to install a software update in Apr, which then needs to be tested. This means that the grounding of the model will not be lifted until at least May, if not later."
Singapore Airlines  - B737 MAX Grounding Not Significant To SIA, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-03-18 ,See attached PDF report for the list of existing Boeing 737 MAX operators.
Singapore Airlines  - B737 MAX Grounding Not Significant To SIA, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-03-18 ,"Apart from the 6 x MAX 8 planes, SilkAir also has 2 x A319s, 8 x A320s and 17 x 737- 800 ‘new-generation’ planes. There are no technical issues for the 737-800 planes."
Singapore Airlines  - B737 MAX Grounding Not Significant To SIA, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-03-18 ,The MAX 8 planes make up 18% of SilkAir’s current fleet but the impact on SilkAir is much smaller than that. We estimate that the MAX 8 flights make up 16% of SilkAir’s seat capacity and 26% of its Available Seat Kilometre (ASK) capacity.
Singapore Airlines  - B737 MAX Grounding Not Significant To SIA, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-03-18 ,"However, with the announced schedule changes for 16-30 Mar, the impact of the MAX 8 grounding will amount to only 1.5% of SilkAir’s systemwide seat capacity as SilkAir has increased the utilisation of its A320 and 737-800 planes and SIA mainline has mounted supplementary widebody flights. Only SIA/SilkAir’s seat capacity to KL, Hyderabad and Wuhan will see mid-teens percentage declines while Phuket will see a mid-single-digit percentage drop."
Singapore Airlines  - B737 MAX Grounding Not Significant To SIA, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-03-18 ,"The MAX 8 planes are envisioned as the cornerstone of its future fleet because SilkAir has orders for a further 31 x MAX planes. Also, SilkAir had planned to retire the existing Airbus fleet and 3 x 737-800 planes and to transfer 14 x 737-800 aircraft and several regional routes to Scoot (originally to be effected between Apr 2019F and 3QCY20F). Once all this is completed, SilkAir will operate only one aircraft type, i.e. the MAX planes, in up to three possible variants (MAX 8/9/10)."
Singapore Airlines  - B737 MAX Grounding Not Significant To SIA, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-03-18 ,"Furthermore, SilkAir plans to retrofit its MAX planes with lie-flat business class seats and seatback In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) in order to offer a comparable product with SIA mainline, upon which SilkAir will be formally merged with its parent company into one SIA brand. All these plans, including the delivery of MAX 8 orders from Boeing, retirement/transfer of other models and seat retrofit, will now likely be delayed due to the MAX grounding."
Singapore Airlines  - B737 MAX Grounding Not Significant To SIA, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-03-18 ,"At the same time, it may be possible for SilkAir to claim compensation from Boeing for the MAX groundings, either in the form of a direct cash transfer or discounts on future aircraft deliveries. We think it is too early to assess the long-term impact on SilkAir and the wider SIA group."

Against the SIA group as a whole, which also includes SIA mainline and Scoot, the significance of SilkAir’s 737 MAX 8 flights are diminished to just 3.5% of the sum total of SIA group’s flight frequencies, 2.3% of group seat capacity and 1.7% of group ASK capacity."
Singapore Airlines  - B737 MAX Grounding Not Significant To SIA, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-03-18 ,"The 737 MAX 8 operations have the lowest significance in Malaysia, where they account for only 2-4% of overall group flight frequencies to Kuala Lumpur and Penang. This is because SilkAir also flies to those destinations using other aircraft types, SIA mainline serves KL separately and Scoot also services those two destinations using the low-cost model."

"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,"As usual, SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L, SIA)'s management provided a cautious outlook during the 3QFY19 analyst briefing. However, the undertone is they have passed the worst and there are just a few tweaks needed."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,"The parent airline and cargo business is operating well, whereas the regional short haul suffers from overcapacity and a sudden fall-off of Chinese tourists."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,We are confident Singapore Airlines will meet our FY19E. Re-iterate BUY and Target Price of SGD11.20 (0.94x FY19F P/BV — its 10-year mean).
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,"The industry is very volatile at the moment due to uncertainty over US-China trade war. This has caused a sudden shift in consumer behaviour, especially business travel and Chinese tourists. Overcapacity looms on certain routes due to this as airlines have yet to adjust their capacities."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,"In Singapore Airlines’s case, routes within the ASEAN region, as well as to China and India are impacted. Otherwise, Singapore Airlines has achieved its first growth in passenger yields since 2016, which indicates the bottom has been reached."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,"Singapore Airlines’s fuel hedge provided net savings of SGD102m in 3QFY19. For 9MFY19, it had net savings of SGD386m."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,"Singapore Airlines has hedged 80% of its 4QFY19 fuel requirements at USD74/bbl, which is slightly lower than the current market price. This will enable Singapore Airlines to price its inventories more effectively and precisely as compared to its competitors that are mostly lightly hedged or entirely on the spot market."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,"We like Singapore Airlines for its modest capacity growth strategy, which should enable it to manage yields relatively better than its competitors. Its fuel hedge reduces operating risk significantly and greatly safeguards positive margins going forward."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,"Furthermore, its sub 5% dividend yield is attractive compared to other carriers and the STI."

The keyword is active capacity management and selling promotional seats well ahead of time. Furthermore, Singapore Airlines is very clinical in adding capacity and quick to make adjustments based on passenger demand."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,Management indicated that the near-term outlook is pretty encouraging and expects a high level of passenger load factor. The areas that are under pressure are the short-haul and budget segment. These business segments are facing overcapacity on certain routes and this is putting pressure on yields.

Cargo still going strong, but dark clouds ahead"
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,"The cargo business is performing well. The Group managed to achieve high-single-digit yield growth, albeit at flat volumes. The US-China trade war spat has created a new level of uncertainty and many cargo shippers have abandoned long-term schedules for one-time consignments. The industry still has pricing power for now as most of the tariffs imposed are not on goods shipped via air and therefore largely unaffected."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,"However, should a new tariff encroach into high-value and time-sensitive cargos, this can quickly diminish air cargo carriers’ pricing power. The situation is very volatile and nobody could put their finger on what would be the next rendition between the US-China trade war episodes."

Risk adverse approach on fuel"
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,"Singapore Airlines has hedged 80% of its 4QFY19 fuel requirements at USD74/bbl, which is slightly lower than the current market price of USD78. For FY20, it has hedged 69% of its fuel requirements at levels below current market prices. Management highlights that it will actively sought more fuel-hedging exposure should the market present itself with opportunities."
"Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2019-02-18 ,Singapore Airlines has the second highest fuel-hedge coverage ratio among the Asia Pacific carriers. This is proving to be a great advantage as it has locked in the fuel price at attractive levels. This also enables Singapore Airlines to sell its tickets longer into the future as the risk profile has been significantly reduced.

Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,"SIA’s 9MFY3/19 core net profit made up 92% of our full-year expectations, which is in line as a typical 4Q is seasonally weak."
Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,"Maintain HOLD due to the tough competition, with an unchanged target price of S$10.25, based on 0.9x CY19F P/BV (1 s.d. below mean since 2001)."
Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,"The outlook for FY20F is better, due to the correction in jet fuel prices since Oct 2018, and because the US$ is no longer likely to appreciate significantly."
Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,"SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L)’s 3QFY19 core net profit of S$284m was 25% lower y-o-y on the back of higher average jet fuel prices, and the depreciation of revenue currencies such as the A$, € and £, while the appreciation of the US$ pushed up operating costs."
Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,"Beyond the headline numbers, however, are some interesting dynamics. SIA mainline’s operating profits were rather flat y-o-y; while cost per available seat km (CASK) growth exceeded revenue per available seat km (RASK) expansion due to fuel cost increases and possible start-up losses of the non-stop A350-900ULR flights to the US that began in Oct and Nov 2018, SIA mainline may have seen growth in some non-ticket incomes."
Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,"SIA group switched to a new revenue management system in CY17 and over the past five quarters had managed to increase SIA mainline’s RASK y-o-y by stimulating a large rise in demand and passenger load factor (PLF) by lowering yields, although CASK growth stole its thunder."
Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,"SilkAir and Scoot’s operating profits fell significantly y-o-y in 3QFY19, but again, there are interesting nuances."
Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,"SilkAir, which had an over-ambitious expansion plan, saw its RASK fall y-o-y over 12 quarters to 2QFY19, but managed to engineer 1.2% growth in RASK in 3QFY19 when its capacity expansion stopped. Unfortunately, this was not sufficient to cover a 4.9% rise in CASK."
Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,"Scoot’s PLF fell 3.6% pts y-o-y in 3QFY19, the first in seven quarters. This may be partly due to the negative demand reaction from the hike in Changi airport tax from 1 Jul 2018, causing its RASK to drop 5.8% y-o-y vs. 8.3% rise in its CASK."
Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,"The momentum for cargo demand and yield improvements have weakened as we progressed to Dec 2018, hence in 3QFY19, SIA’s cargo business failed to deliver growth to its revenue per unit of available freight tonne km (AFTK) capacity for the first time in the eight quarters. Its cargo’s unit profitability shrank y-o-y for the first time in 10 quarters."
Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,Refer to the PDF report attached for comparison of respective operating metrics. 
Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,"Lower oil prices should benefit FY20F earnings, based on an average all-in jet fuel price assumption of US$78.5/bbl for FY19F, and US$76.5/bbl for FY20F (inclusive of hedging gains). This reflects average spot jet fuel price assumptions of US$82/bbl and US$75/bbl, respectively. However, the increasingly-apparent cyclical weakness in cargo demand may offset some of the gains from cheaper fuel prices."
Singapore Airlines  - Outlook For FY20F Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-02-15 ,We have not reflected potential earnings enhancements from the transfer of 14 x 737-800 narrowbody aircraft and regional routes from SilkAir to Scoot (to be effected between Apr 2019F and Jun 2020F).

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3Q19 Results In Line; Maintain BUY, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2019-02-15 ,"Revenue grew 6.5% y-o-y to S$4.34bn mainly on growth in passenger demand with passenger yields being flat. Operating costs outpaced revenue growth at 9.1% y-o-y mainly due to a 22.2% increase in fuel costs as a result of higher average jet fuel price during the quarter. Hence, operating profit fell 14.6% y-o-y to S$387.6m."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3Q19 Results In Line; Maintain BUY, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2019-02-15 ,"On a segmental basis, the flagship SIA passenger business posted a marginal growth in EBIT contribution to S$369m, offset by substantially lower contributions from Silkair (S$7m in 3Q19 vs S$19m in 3Q18) and Scoot (S$1m in 3Q19 and S$43m in 3Q18). SIA ENGINEERING CO LTD (SGX:S59)’s EBIT contribution fell by 16% y-o-y to S$16m."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3Q19 Results In Line; Maintain BUY, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2019-02-15 ,"While SIA’s 3Q earnings were lower compared to last year’s figures, it improved significantly from the previous two quarters, thanks to higher load factors and stringent non-fuel cost control. SIA’s flagship passenger segment performed well by posting an improvement in passenger load factor of 1.8ppts to 83.4% while keeping passenger yield stable, enabling a decent growth in revenues for the segment. This helped to partially offset the weaker performances of Scoot and Silkair, both of which saw weaker yields during the quarter."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3Q19 Results In Line; Maintain BUY, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2019-02-15 ,"Looking ahead, we expect SIA’s 4Q19 earnings to post a y-o-y improvement on lower fuel costs as spot jet fuel prices averaged US$80/bbl while the quarter-to-date average price of spot jet fuel is US$73/bbl and the current price is US$78/bbl."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3Q19 Results In Line; Maintain BUY, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2019-02-15 ,"Coupled with strong momentum from SIA’s transformation programme to spur revenue growth, i.e. focusing on Revenue per Available Seat KM (ASK) through optimising the balance between yield and load factors, this should lead to better earnings for the carrier."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - 3Q19 Results In Line; Maintain BUY, DBS Research , Paul YONG  [CFA] , 2019-02-15 ,"We reiterate our BUY call on SIA, as we believe that lower fuel costs will lead to better earnings over the next two years. At the same time, the ongoing transformation programme could also lead to a sustained improvement in its operations and profits."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - More People Are Flying, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2019-02-15 ,"A robust improvement in revenue (+S$265m) in 3Q largely offset higher fuel and non-fuel expenditure. The former was driven by growth in passenger demand (+S$245m or 7.7%), while cargo flown revenue was steady against last year (+S$3m or 0.5%), as stronger yields offset lower loads carried."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - More People Are Flying, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2019-02-15 ,"Passenger traffic for the group rose 8.0% in 3Q, outpacing capacity growth, resulting in a 0.9ppt improvement in passenger load factor to 83.0%.

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - More People Are Flying, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2019-02-15 ,"For cargo, however, things are starting to slow especially in Dec with a lower yield, mainly due to US-China trade tensions and reduction in demand from Europe."

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - More People Are Flying, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2019-02-15 ,"Meanwhile, from SIA’s perspective, demand for long-haul flight has been strong, and it is generally happy about performance relating to its US flights.

If this trend repeats itself, it would suggest that the passenger yield downtrend is close to bottoming and could stage a recovery."

Singapore Airlines - 3QFY3/19F Results Likely To Be Weak"
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY3/19F Results Likely To Be Weak, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-01-23 ,"We expect SIA’s upcoming results release on 14 Feb to be unexciting, as the headwinds experienced in 2Q continued to persist until end-CY18."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY3/19F Results Likely To Be Weak, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-01-23 ,"Having said that, the outlook for FY20F has improved due to weaker jet fuel prices, and we upgrade our core net profit forecasts accordingly."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY3/19F Results Likely To Be Weak, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-01-23 ,"Maintain HOLD with a slightly higher target price of S$10.25, still based on 0.9x CY19F P/BV, 1 s.d. below mean since 2001."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY3/19F Results Likely To Be Weak, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-01-23 ,"SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L) delivered 2QFY19 core net profit that was 40% lower y-o-y on the back of higher oil prices, and the depreciation of the A$, €, and £ where SIA is net long, and the appreciation of the US$, where SIA is net short. These factors more than offset stronger cargo earnings, and masked SIA mainline’s and Scoot’s successful revenue management efforts (that raised revenue per unit of ASK capacity by lowering ticket prices to stimulate an elastic demand response)."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY3/19F Results Likely To Be Weak, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-01-23 ,"During the Oct-Dec 2018 quarter, we estimate that SIA’s all-in jet fuel prices (inclusive of hedging gains) averaged US$82/bbl, which was higher than the US$72/bbl average in 3QFY18 and also higher than the US$80/bbl of the immediately preceding 2QFY19."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY3/19F Results Likely To Be Weak, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-01-23 ,"While spot oil prices had dropped sharply from early-Oct 2018, airlines’ jet fuel prices generally lag by one month, so the average for 3QFY19 captured the steep rise in spot oil prices during Sep 2018. Also, the currency trends seen during 2QFY19 continued to play out during 3QFY19. As such, we expect SIA’s core net profit to be weaker y-o-y."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY3/19F Results Likely To Be Weak, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-01-23 ,"In addition, SIA may report start-up losses for its non-stop A350-900ULR flights to Newark, Los Angeles and San Francisco, which started in Oct and Nov 2018. Initial promotional fares are likely loss-making, and the premium economy cabin saw low take-up in the initial period."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY3/19F Results Likely To Be Weak, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-01-23 ,"Furthermore, Scoot saw its load factor drop 3.6% pts y-o-y in 3QFY19F, the first time in seven quarters, which may be partially due to the negative demand reaction from the hike in the Changi airport tax from 1 Jul 2018."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY3/19F Results Likely To Be Weak, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-01-23 ,"Finally, the cargo business saw the volume of weight carried contract y-o-y for the first time in six quarters, with a larger drop during the month of Dec 2018, reflecting the global slowdown in GDP and trade growth and the softening of the business cycle."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY3/19F Results Likely To Be Weak, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-01-23 ,"Lower oil prices should benefit earnings in 4QFY19F and FY20F, and we have cut our average FY19F all-in jet fuel price assumption from US$80.2/bbl to US$78.5/bbl, and for FY20F from US$83.4/bbl to US$76.5/bbl. The jet fuel price assumption changes have been reflected in our new core EPS estimates."
Singapore Airlines  - 3QFY3/19F Results Likely To Be Weak, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2019-01-23 ,"However, we have not reflected potential earnings enhancements from the upcoming transfer of 737-800 aircraft and routes from SilkAir to Scoot, which should enhance the profitability of the group as a whole."

Slowing global trade and restocking ahead of the imposition of tariffs by the US were key factors. However, leading indicators such as weak PMI now seem to suggest that the trend of weaker cargo will accelerate into 2020. Thus, we lower our cargo traffic growth assumptions from -2.6% to -3.0% for FY19, and from -1.0% to -4.0% for FY20."

Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"Due to robust yield management strategies, SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L) mainline carrier and Scoot have seen four consecutive quarters of y-o-y increases in revenue per unit of ASK capacity (RASK), as higher load factors have more than offset yield declines. SIA’s cargo operations also continue to see strong demand and yields."
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"The SIA group is also pursuing structural initiatives, like de-emphasising growth of SilkAir in favour of lower-cost Scoot. SIA has relaunched its direct, long-haul flights to the US, which will help boost its short-haul connections and enhance its network connectivity."
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"Capacity expansion by the Middle East and Chinese airlines has generally slowed in recent quarters, and as these carriers do not hedge fuel, we expect them to be more rational in their pricing and capacity expansion going forward. Conversely, SIA’s robust 46% fuel hedge cover until CY22F will protect the group substantially, against less-fortunate, lightly-hedged peers."
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,Rising middle income population supported traveling patterns. We saw this in the strong operating statistics in SATS LTD. (SGX:S58)’ latest 2QFY3/19 earnings with a 13.6% y-o-y increase in passengers handled and +4.6% y-o-y rise in flights handled (+4.6% y-o-y). Cruise Centre was the star performer with 113 ship calls handled (+242% y-o-y).

Land transport"
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"Due to the optimisation and renewal of its taxi fleet in Singapore, COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LTD (SGX:C52) has seen three consecutive quarters of q-o-q increases in operating profit from the taxi business amid expansion of its fleet over the Jul-Sep period. Taxi idle rate remains at 2% and its fleet stood at 12,691 as at end-Sep; ComfortDelGro is expecting to take delivery of up to 700 new hybrid taxis by year-end. Total taxis in Singapore saw a net increase of 115 over the Jul-Sep period, in contrast to a net decline of 2,407 private hire cars in the same period."
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"For its public transport services, ComfortDelGro continued to see y-o-y increases in operating profit over the past six consecutive quarters amid higher ridership across all of its rail services – North East Line (NEL), Sengkang-Punggol LRT (SPLRT) and Downtown Line (DTL) – with the newer DTL’s average daily ridership registering an 82.9% y-o-y increase to 472k passenger trips during the Jul-Sep 18 quarter. The Public Transport Council has also approved a 4.3% hike in rail fares that will take effect by year-end after three consecutive years of fare declines, which should translate into an increase of S$10.9m in train revenue for ComfortDelGro."

Airlines and airport services"
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"Changi Airport raised the passenger service charge (PSC) by S$13.30 effective 1 Jul 2018, representing a 2.5% hike in SIA mainline’s average fares, a 5.6% hike for SilkAir, and a 7% hike for Scoot. Long-haul flights should be immune to this, but demand for short-haul and LCC flights could be impacted, and make it more difficult for the SIA group to pass on higher jet fuel prices. We expect oil prices to rise over the next two years due to the effects of the International Maritime Organization’s global sulphur cap on marine fuels that will take effect from 1 Jan 2020; this has the potential to hurt SIA’s bottomline."
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"IATA recently highlighted that growth in global air passenger demand and airfreight demand has been slowing down, commensurate with the slowdown in global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI). Also, we expect the potential losses from SIA’s launch of direct ultra long-haul (ULR) flights to the US to be visible from 4QCY18F onwards, although they remain strategically critical to SIA."
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,SATS has started to feel the pressure from trade tension as cargo volumes for emerging markets and in/out of China slowed down. Weakening currency from India and Indonesia also eroded some of its associates’ profits.
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"Our airlines analyst, Raymond Yap, is taking a more bullish view on jet fuel prices, which we assume to average US$85/bbl in CY18F, rise to US$90/bbl in CY19F, and to US$95/bbl in CY20F, driven up by US sanctions on Iranian oil exports and by the upcoming IMO 2020 implementation. This is expected to be partially offset by assumed increases in base ticket prices, but this may not fully recover the higher fuel costs. However, the outlook for SIA may be made more challenging in CY20F due to the softening global growth outlook, as indicated by the sequentially declining global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) and the new export orders of the global PMI."
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"For ComfortDelGro, we see robust earnings growth in FY19F (+13% y-o-y), underpinned by stronger earnings from both the taxi and public transport services segments. Notwithstanding Go-JEK entering the private-hire car (PHC) fray but under a more regulated ride-hailing space and given that Uber has exited Southeast Asia after sparking an unsustainable price war, we believe the worst is over for ComfortDelGro’s taxi business. Public transport services should continue to grow, supported by a 4.3% hike in rail fares and overseas acquisitions."
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"Declining growth in trade could also post softness in freights handled by SATS. In the longer term, alternative trade routes into/out of ASEAN (such as Vietnam) could mitigate this, but we do not expect this to take place in the next 12 months."
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"We downgrade the overall transport sector to NEUTRAL from Overweight, following our recent downgrade of SIA to HOLD (see report: Singapore Airlines (SIA) - Risks To Watch Out For)."
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"Our target price for SIA is at S$10.10, based on 0.9x CY19F P/BV, which is at -1 s.d. of its P/BV mean since 2001, as we do not think that investors will be motivated to bid up the share price given the prevailing tough conditions. We do believe, however, that SIA is intrinsically worth at least 1x P/BV over the long term, as the airline group continues to be profitable despite very tough competitive conditions, and continues to invest in its products, services and network that keeps it at, or near, the top of its peers in every way imaginable."
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"ComfortDelGro is our preferred pick in the transport sector with an ADD call on the stock. Our target price of S$2.74 is based on DCF valuation (WACC: 7.4%; LTG: 2%) which implies 18x CY19F P/E. At 14x 12M forward P/E, below its 10-year historical average of 16x, its valuation appears undemanding, in our view."
Navigate Singapore 2019 ~ Transport Sector  - NEUTRAL, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Colin TAN  | LIM Siew Khee , 2018-11-29 ,"We have a HOLD call on SATS with a Target Price of S$5.06, based on 20x CY19F P/E (3-year mean). Re-rating catalysts could come from sizeable earnings-accretive M&As. At c.19x CY19F, the stock appears fairly traded with potential risks from further devaluation of emerging market currency and weaker-than-expected cargo handling volume as a result of trade tension."

SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"Our year-end report for the Oil and Gas sector last year was titled “Awaiting contract wins”, in which we expected a gradual recovery in 2018 and mentioned that a re-rating of stocks in the sector would require a continued flow of contract wins. We recall that there was significant excitement in the market in the earlier part of this year, with great expectations for new order wins especially for Sembcorp Marine (SGX:S51) (along with speculation of a possible merger), but both disappointed as we cruised through the year. This is despite crude prices continuing their upward climb till end Sep, before dropping steadily in the last two months or so."
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"We believe a clear point of realization for some erst-while bulls came in mid Jul when Sembcorp Marine’s management mentioned that the group’s transformation efforts to move up the value chain has resulted in new business opportunities but they require significant time and effort in project co-development with potential customers. Such new-build EPC projects have detailed engineering and construction planning phase, which may take as long as six to 12 months before main construction activities and corresponding revenue recognition can take place."

SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), US crude oil production reached 11.3m bbl/day in Aug 2018 – the first time that monthly US production levels surpassed 11m bbl/day. The growth in Texas and New Mexico production since the start of 2018 surpassed EIA’s previous expectations, which assumed that pipeline capacity constraints in the Permian region would dampen production growth. However, industry efficiencies in pipeline utilisation and increased trucking and tail transport in the region have allowed crude oil production to continue to grow at a higher rate than expected."
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"Over the past 10 years, US crude oil production has increased significantly (Exhibit 5 in the PDF report attached), driven mainly by production from tight oil formations using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. EIA estimates of crude oil production from tight formations in Aug 2018 reached 6.2m bbl/day, or 55% of the national total."

US - now the world’s top crude producer; upside supply risks remain"
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"The US crude oil production of 11.3m bbl/day in Aug was also more than the Russian Ministry of Energy’s estimated Aug production of 11.2m bbl/day, making the US the leading crude oil producer in the world. The oil price decline in mid 2014 resulted in US producers reducing their costs and temporarily scaling back production. However, after crude oil prices increased in early 2016, investment and production began increasing later that year. In comparison, Russia and Saudi Arabia have maintained relatively steady crude oil production growth in recent years."
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"Looking ahead, EIA forecasts US crude oil production to increase by 1.0m bbl/day in 2019, and we see upside supply risks which may cap the upside on oil prices."
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"Overall, the utilisation rate of marketed rigs has continued to increase this year, and is now hovering slightly under 75%. Supply of marketed rigs has decreased slightly, while supply of the entire rig fleet has fallen to a greater degree with scrapping of older units."
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"However, for a better idea of the outlook for our local yards, it is useful to drill down and look at the three main rig segments in turn – jack-ups, semi-submersibles and drillships."
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"After declining significantly in 2014-2016, utilisation rates for harsh environment jack-ups in NW Europe saw stabilization in 2017 before recovering this year, such that current utilisation rates hover around 65- 70% (Exhibit 9). Utilisation has to increase more first before we can see a recovery in day rates. This has been one of the segments that Keppel Corp (SGX:BN4) and Sembcorp Marine have been focused on, and a continued recovery may herald better news for both companies. In comparison, the shallow water jack-ups in the SE Asia region (Exhibit 8 in the PDF report attached) did not see a recovery unlike the NW Europe harsh environment jack-ups."
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"For ultra-deepwater semi-submersibles (Exhibit 10 in the PDF report attached), the utilization rate remains low at around 35%, and average day rates remain low as well. Unlike other rig types, this segment has not seen an uptick in utilisation rates. "
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"As for the drillship segment (Exhibit 11 in the PDF report attached), utilisation levels seem to have found a bottom in 2017, and there has been an uptick in 2018. The recovery is likely to be a very gradual one, which is not surprising given that the deep-water space is usually lagging in the recovery process. "
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"The transport sector is very much affected by oil prices as well, due to fuel costs. However, the extent varies as well. ComfortDelgro’s business segments include public transport operations, and fare adjustments are also tied to fuel costs as well, to either contain the upside or compensate ComfortDelgro when fuel costs swing. "
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"In comparison, fuel costs affect airlines to a greater extent, but it also depends on the amount of hedges that the airline uses. In 1HFY19, fuel costs (post hedging) accounted for 30% of SIA’s total costs. For 2HFY19, SIA has hedged 58% of its fuel requirements in MOPS (jet fuel) at a weighted average price of US$71, against the current MOPS price of US$87. For FY20, 52% is hedged with 17% at US$79 on average for jet fuel) and 35% at US$56 on average for Brent. "

Outlook for transport-related names "
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"Oil prices aside, we expect ComfortDelgro (SGX:C52)’s growth to be driven by overseas acquisitions, supported by stable operating cash flows from public transport operations in Singapore. So far this year, the group has invested about S$450m in overseas acquisitions, mainly in Australia. As for its taxi operations, the market is likely to focus on the actions that Go-Jek would take in its entry to Singapore. Should an aggressive pricing strategy be pursued, sentiment on the stock may be affected. We estimate that the Singapore taxi business accounts for about 20-25% of operating income for the group. "
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"For SIA (SGX:C6L), passenger load factors should remain strong on robust passenger growth, but passenger yields may be capped by intense competition from rival airlines. For 2HFY19, earnings should improve on weaker oil prices. Over the longer term, this is a capital intensive business and significant capital expenditure is expected, and we forecast an increase in net gearing for the group. "

Gradual recovery in 2019; continued flow of orders needed "
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"Looking ahead in 2019, we expect the offshore oil and gas sector to continue its gradual recovery, underpinned by cost deflation across the industry and lower break evens. Orders are still mainly expected from the non-drilling segment as recovery in the drilling market will still take time. However, should there be significant contract wins in 2019 for Keppel Corp (SGX:BN4) and Sembcorp Marine, we see chances for trading opportunities especially for the latter."
SG Industrial Stocks  - Opt For Resilience & Low Valuations, OCBC Investment , Low Pei Han  [CFA] , 2018-11-29 ,"A sustained recovery, however, will only ensue with a continued flow of contract wins, which will drive a re-rating of related stocks in the sector. "

Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Risks To Watch Out For, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2018-11-12 ,the start-up losses from the ULR flights.
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Risks To Watch Out For, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2018-11-12 ,"We have cut our FY88-88F core net profit forecasts by 88-88%, as we raise our S$:US$8 assumption from S$8.88 to S$8.88 for all forecast years, and as we raise our spot jet fuel price assumption from US$88/bbl in FY88-88F to US$88/bbl for FY88F and US$88/bbl for FY88F. This is partially offset by an assumed increase in base ticket prices, but this is not expected to fully recover the higher fuel costs."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Risks To Watch Out For, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2018-11-12 ,"Our target price of S$88.88 is based on 8.8x CY88F P/BV, which is 8 standard deviation below the P/BV mean since 8888. Our previous target price of S$88.88 was based on 8.88x CY88F P/BV, which is approximately the P/BV mean. We have used a lower P/BV multiple to establish our 8-year forward target price for SIA, as we do not think that investors will be motivated to bid up the share price with the prevailing tough conditions."
Singapore Airlines (SIA)  - Risks To Watch Out For, CGS-CIMB , Raymond YAP  [CFA] | Calyne TI , 2018-11-12 ,"We do believe, however, that SIA is intrinsically worth at least 8x P/BV over the long term, as the airline group continues to be profitable despite very tough competitive conditions, and continues to invest in its product, service and network that keeps it at, or near, the top of its peers in every way imaginable."
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"
Singapore Airlines - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price"
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"We estimate a 2QFY19 (out 13 Nov) core net profit of SGD118m (-38% y-o-y, -16% q-o-q). We think yield attrition and higher jet fuel prices will weigh on its bottom line. Otherwise, the company has done a good job of raising overall loads by 1.7ppts y-o-y to 73.3%, a record since 2010."
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"We raise FY19-21E earnings by 3.9-5.5% to factor in higher load factors, its latest traffic-growth plans and new USD/SGD estimates."
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"Our Target Price climbs to SGD9.80, still at FY20E P/BV of 0.82x, 1SD below its 10-year mean."
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"SIA’s share price has declined by 13% in the last quarter. As we believe this has priced in its near-term challenges, upgrade to HOLD."
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,Overall traffic (passenger + cargo) in 2QFY19 grew 2.9% y-o-y. Load factor went up by 1.7% y-o-y to 73.3%. This was the group’s highest load factor since 2010.
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,Changi Airport has slapped a SGD13.30 or 39% increase in passenger tariffs beginning Jul 2018.
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,We also notice that published ticket fares are on the low side and factor in an 8% yield decline for 2QFY19 (8% decline in 1QFY19).
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"The fuel market is exceptionally volatile due to the US-China trade war and US embargo on Iran. As SIA has hedged 47% of its FY19 requirements at USD65/bbl (Brent), it should be better positioned than the other airlines."
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"SIA’s 2QFY19 will be saddled with big losses from its 20% associate, Virgin Australia (VAH AU, Not Rated), which reported a net loss of AUD603.5m in its 2H18 results. SIA’s share of losses could be SGD50-60m in 2QFY19 but we deem this non-core as the bulk is accounting in nature."
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,We also believe we have adequately factored in its near-term risks.
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"
Traffic growth healthy"
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"Passengers carried by the group grew 8.4% y-o-y to 9.1m in 2QFY19. This was above its long-term average of 5% growth (excluding its Tigerair acquisition), which suggests healthy passenger traffic growth."
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,Cargo growth was equally healthy at 2.9% y-o-y in 2QFY19.
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"
Load factor"
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,Group passenger load factor soared by 3.1ppts y-o-y to 84.9% in 2QFY19. We think yields were dropped in order to promote loads.
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"Cargo load factor was slightly down by 0.5ppt y-o-y to 63.5%. The air cargo industry has been performing very well in the past 2.5 years, driven by growth in the electronics segment and Internet retail sales."
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"SIA has been trading range-bound, close to 1SD below its P/BV mean, in the past two years. We believe 1SD below mean is an apt valuation, given that its short-term outlook is clouded by volatile fuel prices, higher Changi Airport charges and huge one-off losses from Virgin Australia."
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"Using a one-year forward P/BV of 0.82x, we derive a Target Price of SGD9.80 after our earnings revisions."
Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2018-11-09 ,"SIA’s share price has declined by 13% in the last three months. As we believe this has priced in its near-term challenges, upgrade to HOLD from SELL."

Swing Factors "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,SIA’s 4QFY16 and FY16 results were way below ours and consensus expectations. 
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"Yields were much weaker and the cargo business continued to lose money?. However, to its credit, SIA has achieved credible unit cost reduction through efficiency gains. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"We lower our FY17-18 forecasts by -3.2% and -6.7%, respectively to incorporate its latest fuel hedges and lower yields, and introduce a FY19 forecast. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"Maintain HOLD with a 2.5% lower TP of SGD11.5 (from SGD11.8), pegged to an unchanged 1x FY17 P/BV, which is SIA’s historical mean. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"Central to SIA’s quandary are the three giant Middle Eastern carriers, which have made commanding inroads into the premium segment. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"Secondly, all the mainline Chinese carriers have splurged capacity on trans-Pacific flights and this has hurt SIA’s market share, as well as marginalize its cargo segment. These pressures are unlikely to abate anytime soon, in our view. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"The bright sparks were Silkair and Scoot, which delivered strong YoY growth. Tigerair also breakeven in FY16. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"We forecast overall yields (passenger + cargo) to erode by a further 3.7% in FY17 as the long-haul sector continues to face stiff competition. However, we forecast unit cost to decline by 4.2% YoY in FY17 as SIA enjoys the benefit of the lower fuel price as its expensive fuel hedges expire. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"SIA will also derive some cost savings on the planned removal of two older Boeing B747-4F, one Boeing B777-3 and four Airbus A330-3, and replace them with ultra-modern and efficient new aircraft models. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"SIA announced a DPS of SGD0.35 (+106% YoY), bringing the full-year total to SGD0.45 (+105% YoY). "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,Its 65% payout ratio is among the highest in the industry and the current dividend yield of 4.0% will appeal to certain investors and provide downside support to the share price.
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"Management expects an extremely challenging operating environment for the
year. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"The Middle Eastern and also Chinese carriers are growing at a fast pace and
hurting the yields on the premium segment. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"The budget segment is more resilient
and is growing strongly. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"The core growth markets for SIA are India and China. Management is optimistic
regarding buoyant demand in these two countries, driven by a strong domestic
economy, a resurgence of the middle income class population, and a rapidly
globalizing economy. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"We agree with management’s views that India and China
are indeed the new ‘big market’ for a long time to come. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"There will be a net addition of ten aircraft in FY17, with the addition of 17
aircraft and the removal of seven older aircraft from the fleet. This includes the
decommissioning of two freighter aircraft, its first reduction since 2011. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"SIA will
induct the ultra-modern Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 aircraft models, whilst
removing the older Boeing 777-3, Airbus A330-3, and Boeing 747-4F. This fleet
rejuvenation should help reduce unit cost and possibly appeal to more
customers. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"We are positive with management’s action to rejuvenate its fleet, as SIA has the
oldest average fleet age of any state carrier in the ASEAN region. But we are
concerned with the high number of net fleet additions in FY17. For the past five
years, SIA has typically only grown its fleet by 3-5 aircraft p.a.. Therefore, we
think there is a high probability that SIA will return five leased Airbus A380
aircraft that are due to expire to the lessor in 2017. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"There were plenty of
questions regarding the A380 aircraft status, but management was adamant that
it has yet to reach such a decision. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"There has been wide speculation in the press that Tigerair and Scoot will be
merged soon, which management has not denied nor confirmed. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"We believe it
will eventually happen, and the real question is when? In our opinion, it would be
mutually beneficial longer-term, assuming they can streamline operations and
reduce the overlapping staff functions. Should the merger story occur, we think
it could potentially improve the sentiment on the counter. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"Yield is the most important earnings driver, but the trend
has been negative for the past three years. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"Low fuel price is providing a significant cost reduction
and boost to the bottom line. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"Strong demand and supply scarcity in the region should
drive up loads and yields in the medium term. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"Tigerair acquisition is costly and the market is keen to
see how it extracts value to benefit the Group. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"An increase in the value of the SGD against destination
countries and the USD will have an adverse effect on
yields. "
Singapore Airlines  - Always on the back foot, Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2016-05-16 ,"Increased competitive pressure from the Middle Eastern
carriers and also from regional peers who have upgraded
their fleets and services. "

Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"SIA’s full-year FY16 core net profit came in 6% below expectations, implying a 4Q that underperformed 22%, mainly due to more-than-expected yield declines. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"The group increased its profits in FY16 vs. FY15, as lower oil prices more than offset yield declines, but the incremental fuel price drop will be smaller in FY17. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"Juxtapose that against accelerating yield declines, and the group may not deliver EPS growth this year, which is why we have cut FY17-18 core EPS by 29-34%. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"We think it is time to lock in SIA’s outperformance, hence we downgrade from Add to Hold; our target is lowered to S$12.42, still based on P/BV of 1.1x (avg since 2001). "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"The SIA group grew its full-year core earnings by 61%, as the lagged effect of lower oil prices finally flowed down to the bottom line with the gradual expiry of expensive legacy fuel hedges. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"The passenger airlines businesses (mainline SIA, SilkAir, Scoot and Tigerair) all saw improved profits for that reason. SilkAir and Scoot also had the benefit of new 737 and 787 planes, respectively, which helped them to improve operating efficiencies. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"The 4Q yield declines accelerated across the board, and could extend into FY17. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"The continuing decline of mainline SIA’s monthly yields is of special concern, due to weakness in long-haul and premium travel demand. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"The cargo business was especially dire, with SIA Cargo delivering its largest loss in almost three years, due to weak demand and excess capacity, causing large yield declines. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"Scoot was the only airline within the group that did not see its yields decline, despite growing its capacity 41% yoy in 2HFY16. Instead, it reported its second consecutive quarterly profit in 4Q16, which was even higher than the immediately preceding 3Q, and surprisingly equalled that of SilkAir in just a few short years of its existence. This was achieved on the back of strong demand which lifted loads to 85% (the highest in the SIA group), the growing maturity of its route network, and its new and efficient 787s. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"SilkAir delivered much stronger earnings than the year before, with a modest yield drop that was more than offset by a larger unit cost decline. The latter was achieved on the back of the new 737 fleet, capacity expansion and lower oil prices. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"Once concern is that SilkAir’s 4Q16 yields fell at a faster pace of 8.2% yoy, vs. 3Q16’s 3.5% decline. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"The group’s all-in price of jet fuel fell US$33/bbl yoy in FY16 (to US$84), but we forecast it to drop ‘only’ US$13/bbl in FY17 (to US$71), inclusive of hedging losses. This is based on a spot price assumption of US$60 and SIA’s existing 31% hedge book at an average strike price of US$81. The smaller drop is of concern if yield declines accelerate. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,"The cargo business could see larger losses in FY17, while mainline SIA’s profits could shrink slightly on yield pressures, offset by higher earnings at SilkAir and Scoot. "
Singapore Airlines  - Hard for SIA to grow earnings in near term, CIMB Research , Raymond YAP  [CFA] , 2016-05-13 ,The net result could be flattish group profits that may not inspire share price performance.

Singapore Airlines  - Committed to interest in Virgin Australia, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-04-11 ,Australasia a key market for SIA 
Singapore Airlines  - Committed to interest in Virgin Australia, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-04-11 ,"Earlier last month, Virgin Australia (VAH) started its review of capital structure and as an initial step, it secured a new 12-month A$425m loan facility with its four major shareholders including Air New Zealand (Air NZ, 25.9%) and Singapore Airlines (SIA, 23.1%). "
Singapore Airlines  - Committed to interest in Virgin Australia, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-04-11 ,"However, Air NZ announced late last month that it is now considering partial or full exit from its investment in VAH, currently valued at ~A$338m (7 Apr close). "
Singapore Airlines  - Committed to interest in Virgin Australia, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-04-11 ,SIA also subsequently stated that it is committed to providing its proportion of the shareholder loan to VAH. 
Singapore Airlines  - Committed to interest in Virgin Australia, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-04-11 ,"Over the past five years, VAH has transformed from being a pure low-cost carrier to become a more diversified carrier, competing in the same space as the established full service carrier, Qantas, which is also a fierce rival of SIA on inbound and outbound routes from Australia and New Zealand. "
Singapore Airlines  - Committed to interest in Virgin Australia, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-04-11 ,"More recently, SIA increased its stake in VAH from 22.9% to 23.1% through a series of equity swaps, done at a premium to the open market price. While the increase in stake is only 0.2%, we believe the key inference one should draw from these transactions is SIA showing its commitment in its interest in VAH. "
Singapore Airlines  - Committed to interest in Virgin Australia, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-04-11 ,"Apart from Europe, Australasia is another key market of SIA, and a majority stake in VAH may help SIA compete more effectively with the existing dominant player – Qantas. Therefore, we do not rule out the possibility of SIA buying over Air NZ’s stake in VAH, but such action will trigger a takeover bid (based on ASX rules). "
Singapore Airlines  - Committed to interest in Virgin Australia, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-04-11 ,"In our view, gaining control of VAH could lift SIA’s competitiveness in the Australasia market with a larger presence and network synergy with the main group. "
Singapore Airlines  - Committed to interest in Virgin Australia, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-04-11 ,"All said, with nothing confirmed, such possibility remains a speculative view but investors may want to monitor for further corporate actions ahead. "
Singapore Airlines  - Committed to interest in Virgin Australia, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-04-11 ,"In our view, the near-term focus for SIA continues to hinge on earnings recovery resulting from cheap jet fuel and a beneficial hedging position for at least FY17. "
Singapore Airlines  - Committed to interest in Virgin Australia, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-04-11 ,"Keeping our forecasts unchanged for now, we reiterate BUY on SIA with the same FV of S$12.50. "

"Singapore Aviation  - Strong Growth In Changi Airport Bodes Well For SATS, SIA And SIA Engineering In 4QFY16", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2016-04-01 ,We believe SATS will be the primary beneficiary of what appears to be a trend reversal in visitor arrivals as it has an 80% share of all flights handled and meals served at Changi. 
"Singapore Aviation  - Strong Growth In Changi Airport Bodes Well For SATS, SIA And SIA Engineering In 4QFY16", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2016-04-01 ,SIA Engineering will also benefit via higher line maintenance checks but its longer-term growth remains at risk.

"Singapore Aviation  - Strong Growth In Changi Airport Bodes Well For SATS, SIA And SIA Engineering In 4QFY16", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2016-04-01 ,"January’s traffic growth was led by a whopping 56% yoy rise in visitor arrivals from China. Visitors from Indonesia, the second largest segment, rose 9% yoy. This could be due to a low base in the aftermath of the Indonesia AirAsia QZ8501 crash in Dec 14.

Both SATS’ unit meals and unit services have high correlations of 78% and 72% to the number of pax handled and flights handled at Changi respectively. "
"Singapore Aviation  - Strong Growth In Changi Airport Bodes Well For SATS, SIA And SIA Engineering In 4QFY16", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2016-04-01 ,"Assuming Changi airport’s pax throughput rises 9% in 1Q16, SATS unit services could rise 11-14% in 4QFY16, which could in turn boost gateway services revenue by 6-7%. This is higher than our implied estimate of a 3% growth in gateway services. "

Singapore Airlines  - Cheap jet fuel to lift FY17 earnings, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-03-18 ,"Despite mixed global economic data, traffic for its parent airline grew 3.8% and 5.1% YoY, which led to a 3.7ppt and 2.2ppt improvement in passenger load factors (PLF) in Jan 16 and Feb 16, respectively. "
Singapore Airlines  - Cheap jet fuel to lift FY17 earnings, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-03-18 ,"The improvements in PLF were broad-based across all regions supported by promotional activities, led by East Asia (+6.5ppt) in Jan 16 and Europe (+4.3ppt) in Feb 16. "

Singapore Airlines  - Cheap jet fuel to lift FY17 earnings, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-03-18 ,"While operating results were encouraging, we believe SIA may be sacrificing yields to ensure stable passenger loads. "
Singapore Airlines  - Cheap jet fuel to lift FY17 earnings, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-03-18 ,Pricing competition is likely to persist as Gulf carriers continue to expand into SIA’s key routes to Europe and the low oil price environment may exacerbate such competition since it increases the ability of airlines to price down tickets. 
Singapore Airlines  - Cheap jet fuel to lift FY17 earnings, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-03-18 ,"Being one of the key beneficiaries of cheap jet fuel, SIA is also likely able to compete on pricing through promotional activities to maintain its market share, at least on its key Europe routes. That said, we expect cheap jet fuel to more than offset the low yields in FY17. "
Singapore Airlines  - Cheap jet fuel to lift FY17 earnings, OCBC Investment , Eugene Chua , 2016-03-18 ,"In addition, we expect profitability on both SilkAir and Scoot to improve further, and potentially even more if interlining traffic between Scoot and Tigerair can be captured effectively. "

Singapore Airlines SIA  - 2QFY16 ~ Earnings Below Expectations But Scope For Improvement, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-11-06 ,"Some S$50m of the increase was from higher maintenance cost (+32.1% yoy), which SIA attributed to retrofitting premium economy seats. Aircraft rentals also rose by S$55m (+29.9% yoy) presumably due to higher aircraft leases. Going forward, we believe maintenance costs will normalise. "
Singapore Airlines SIA  - 2QFY16 ~ Earnings Below Expectations But Scope For Improvement, UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-11-06 ,"This is due to fuel hedges at lower levels, which on its own will provide much of the likely hoh improvement in earnings.

"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,We expect SIA to report a 52% yoy rise in 2QFY16 net profit due to improved profitability at the parent airline. 
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,"For SIAEC, we are expecting a 10% yoy rise in 2QFY16 operating profit due to a weak base and a likely increase in A380-related “C” checks. "
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,"Meanwhile, SATS is expected to register an 18% yoy increase in 2QFY16 net profit due to improved gateway services margin and cost savings. "

"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,"The parent airline is expected to report an operating profit of S$180.8m, driven by higher pax load and lower fuel costs but offset partially by lower pax yield. We have estimated a 4.6% yoy decline in pax yields and essentially assumed the pace of decline has continued from that in May-Jun 15. Every 0.1 S cent change from our base assumption will impact the parent airline’s operating profit and group net profit by S$25m and S$20m respectively. "
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,"Meanwhile, existing fuel hedges are expected to lead to more than S$200m fuel hedging losses for the period. "
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,"Overall, we expect SIA to declare an unchanged interim dividend of 5 cents/share. "
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,"In the previous down cycle, yields only bottomed out two quarters after jet fuel prices bottomed out. A similar scenario could pan out over the next two quarters. "
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,"SIAEC could see higher airframe revenue due to “C” checks on SIA’s A380 aircraft. We are however doubtful of a meaningful improvement in engine maintenance revenue, which declined by almost 42% in the previous quarter. "
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,We expect a 1 S cent decline in interim dividend to 5 S cents/share. 
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,"Higher unit services and unit meals are expected to lead to a small revenue growth, while lower raw material costs and licensing fees are expected to boost operating profit. On the revenue front, SATS had resumed handling Jetstar Asia’s gateway operations from Jul 15, which we believe accounted for most of the increase in unit services. "
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,"On the cost front, raw material costs are likely to have declined in line with the lower commodity prices, while rebates announced by Changi Airport is likely to lead to lower opex. "
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,We estimate its interim dividend is likely to remain unchanged at 5 S cents/share. 
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,"TFK secured a S$325m long-term contract from Delta Airlines, which should start contributing in 2HFY16. We reckon TFK was operating close to breakeven level in previous quarters and that the Delta contract will boost operating profit. "
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,"The extent of yield decline and quantum of fuel hedges will be the key focus areas. If the decline in yield is less than expected due to better pricing or a weaker Singapore dollar, it will have positive ramifications for the remaining quarters. "
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,SIAEC will be hosting an analyst briefing. We will seek greater clarity on the trend for third-party maintenance and engine checks. SIAEC cut interim and final dividends in FY15. 
"Aviation Singapore  - Earnings Preview For SIA, SIAEC And SATS", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-28 ,"ASP for gateway services and inflight catering will be key focus areas. If yields stabilise, particularly for gateway services, that will hold scope for higher margins. We would also seek greater clarity on the increase in unit services and meals. Associate income typically accounts for 15-20% of pre-tax profit. A qoq decline could suggest that associates were impacted by lower cargo handled or translation losses. "

"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,Cut FY16-18 EPS by 9-11% after imputing revised lower traffic growth & the latest jet-fuel & USD/SGD assumptions. 
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,Downgrade to HOLD from BUY due to limited upside and no immediate catalyst. TP marginally lowered to SGD11.80. 
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"We downgrade the share in light of persistent soft yield environment and management’s plans to taper down future growth capacity plans. Otherwise, 2QFY16 operating statistics were in line with our expectations. "
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"System traffic growth rose 11.2% YoY and load factor, 1.9ppt YoY to 70.8%. This was its highest load factor since 2002. "
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"Load factor is impressive, but this came at the expense of lower yields as competitors cut prices to gain market share and loads. SIA has to reciprocate by dropping its fares but is saddled with expensive fuel hedges: 55% of its fuel in 2QFY16 had been fixed at USD104/bbl vs an average market price of USD66/bbl. "
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,We cut FY16-18 EPS by 11.4%/8.5%/10.5% after filtering revenue generated from aircraft slot trades which we deem non-recurring. 
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"We also adjust capacity-growth assumptions based on management’s inputs and our yield, jet-fuel and USD/SGD assumptions. "

"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"Group - parent airline, Silk Air, Scoot and Tigerair - passenger load factor
improved 1.9ppts YoY to 83.1% in 2QFY16. This was its best quarterly load
factor since it started publishing the information. Traffic growth was flat
as ASK shrank 0.1% YoY. From this, we infer that this was the second year
that the group’s capacity has not grown. Management says it will inject
capacity growth in CY2016, supported by incoming fleet deployment. "
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"The cargo market was less buoyant as its load factor shrank 1.7ppts YoY to
60.3%. Load factor has been languishing at its 5-year low mark since Apr
2015. Cargo capacity grew 2.6% YoY in 2QFY16. Management pointed to a
weak air-freight industry that is suffering from overcapacity."
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"Almost all the geographical segments exhibited an exceptional Jul-Aug
2015 before easing in Sep 2015. We are not concerned by the drop in Sep
2015 load factors as it coincided with flight frequency addition. The
standouts are the Australasia and European sectors, which are achieving
above 90% load factors. This momentum should continue into 2HFY16 and
deliver even better YoY comparisons as 2HFY15 was saddled by specific
challenges on the Southeast and North Asian routes. "
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"Firstly, we filter the SGD110m compensation received in 1QFY16 for the
release of seven aircraft delivery slots meant for FY18-19 as we deem this
as non-recurring income ― this information was only revealed during the
1QFY16 analyst briefing.
We use management’s latest guidance on capacity deployment, which will
shrink marginally. "
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"Overall yields have been tweaked lower to reflect
current industry trends. Our fuel-price assumptions have taken into
account SIA’s latest fuel hedges. Based on these assumptions, we forecast
a core net PATAMI of SGD650.3m (+314% YoY). This is 11.4% lower than our
previous estimate of SGD734.3m. "
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"The SGD has weakened against the USD

"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"Again we use management’s latest guidance on capacity growth and use
our latest house USD/SGD forex rate. We taper down our yield assumption
to reflect the current weak yield environment. Our fuel-price assumptions
have taken into account SIA’s latest fuel hedges. Based on these
assumptions, we forecast a core net PATAMI of SGD808.1m (+24.3% YoY).
This is 8.5% lower than our previous estimate of SGD828.1m. "
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"We use management’s latest guidance on fleet deployment to ascertain
capacity growth. We expect the high number of aircraft deployment to
accelerate traffic growth to 5.0%. We assume an average jet fuel price of
USD100/bbl, and this will be adjusted as necessary. Based on these
assumptions, we forecast a core net PATAMI of SGD879.8m (+8.9% YoY).
This is 10.5% lower than our previous estimate of SGD983.3m."
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"Our revised target price is SGD11.80, down marginally from SGD11.85, on

"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"Our revised TP is still pegged
to 1x FY17 P/BV, which is close to its long-term mean of 0.98x. This should
be a good floor-price indicator for the airline as the company will produce
healthy earnings and strong balance sheet."

New York, and Singapore to Los Angeles as well as other points in the US by
2018. SIA will utilize the latest generation Airbus A350-900 ultra-long-haul
(ULH) aircraft that is capable of flying up to 8,700nm.
SIA previously had daily services to New York and Los Angeles, which were
exceptionally popular among customers but it was discontinued in 2013 as
it was unfeasible due to high fuel prices. SIA is sanguine that the new
generation A350-900 ULH has superior cost economics and ensures
profitable operations. "
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"We are neutral on this announcement as it is many
years away and have no financial implication in the short term. "
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"Scoot will operate the Singapore to Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) services from 1
May 2016, effectively taking the route over from SIA. This is to optimize
the landing slots as Scoot’s Boeing 787-8 aircraft has 335 seats as opposed
to SIA’s Airbus A330-300’s 285 seats (+17.5% more seats). Moreover, the
route caters specifically to religious pilgrims whom sole focus is for lower
cost of travel rather than premium services. "
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"This is a wise decision by management to right-fit the product profile to
passenger demand. However, there is brand-equity erosion on the part of
SAI as this route is a major void in the airline’s ambition to become a
globally connected player. Jeddah is a key aviation destination with over
70 airlines servicing the route and direct global connectivity to more than
200 destinations. "
"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"All things considered, we believe the commercial decision by management
to replace SIA flight with Scoot is the best trade off. "

"Singapore Airlines  - 2QFY16 ~ D/G to HOLD, lacks catalyst", Maybank Kim Eng , Mohshin Aziz , 2015-10-26 ,"This tie-up reinforces our view that Tigerair will eventually be taken
private by the Group. We believe there will be further co-operation and
tie-ups as it is inevitable to behave as part of the Group. Therefore, it
would be much easier on the Group to privatise Tigerair to absolve itself
from making countless regulatory announcements and due considerations. "

"Singapore Airlines  - Weak September Loads, But Still A Qoq Improvement", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-16 ,"Despite flat performance for September, overall pax loads for 2QFY16 have improved, supported by both capacity reductions and traffic growth. "

"Singapore Airlines  - Weak September Loads, But Still A Qoq Improvement", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-16 ,"SIA’s 2QFY16 load factors improved 1.8ppt; pace of improvement tapers off in Sep 15. The improvement was mainly aided by capacity reductions (-1.6%). Overall, 2QFY16’s pax traffic was flat yoy, with September reversing the preceding months’ upward trend. This lacklustre traffic growth comes despite promotional activities and the summer travel demand. "
"Singapore Airlines  - Weak September Loads, But Still A Qoq Improvement", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-16 ,Pax loads to key markets Europe and US reversed from two consecutive months of gains to a decline in September. The 2.1ppt and 1.4ppt decline in loads to Europe and the US in Sep 15 could be due to recent capacity additions by Qatar at Changi. 
"Singapore Airlines  - Weak September Loads, But Still A Qoq Improvement", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-16 ,"Improved load factor likely to lead SIA into black in 2QFY16. In the previous period, SIA’s parent operations was S$2m in the red, excluding S$110m in slot compensation. In the current period, SIA’s pax load factor is 7.4ppt higher qoq. Thus, unless SIA’s pax yield declines by more than 9% qoq, the parent airline is likely to be profitable in the current quarter. "
"Singapore Airlines  - Weak September Loads, But Still A Qoq Improvement", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-16 ,"Cargo traffic improved in Sep 15 with stronger loads to the South West Pacific market (+9.0%), but expected to continue to post a loss in 2QFY16. Cargo loads improved to South West Pacific, Asia and Africa, despite a decline to the Europe and US markets. The stronger loads are likely to be IT-related shipments, such as iPhones and electronic gadgets. However, we reckon the improvement comes on the back of reduced cargo yields. With cargo load factors still 0.8ppt lower than in 1QFY16 (61.1%), we expect cargo operations to continue to be in the red. "
"Singapore Airlines  - Weak September Loads, But Still A Qoq Improvement", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-16 ,"2Q is a seasonally stronger period compared with 1Q and thus improved profitability should not come as a surprise.

As of Sep 15, SIA has guided that “promotional activities will continue in relevant markets”. "
"Singapore Airlines  - Weak September Loads, But Still A Qoq Improvement", UOB Kay Hian , K Ajith  | Sophie Leong , 2015-10-16 ,"Premium traffic is an integral part of SIA’s business, accounting for more than one-third of revenue historically.

However, in the near to medium-term, we believe Gulf carriers continue to be a significant threat with aggressive expansion plans and we see pressures ahead on both yields and loads.
