      "We expect SIA (SGX:C6L) to do very well in the coming quarters, due to the combination of rising capacity restoration, strong demand, high load factors and robust yields. For FY23F (1 Apr 2022 to 31 Mar 2023) as a whole, we think that the SIA group should be able to restore 74% of its pre-COVID-19 capacity, rising to at least 95% in FY24F or higher if China reopens its borders sooner.",
      "Competition has also been relatively muted so far, with airlines in Southeast Asia gradually ramping up capacity deployment and certain key competitors such as Cathay Pacific and the mainland Chinese airlines still held back by Hong Kong\u2019s border controls.",
      "On the demand side, SIA expects the strong demand in 1QFY23 to continue until Dec 2022, based on the robust forward booking curve.",
      "In 1QFY23, SIA group achieved a passenger load factor (PLF) of 79%, with Jun 2022 PLF at 85.5%. The strength in demand continued into Jul 2022 with PLF at 87.4%, which is the second-highest PLF in SIA\u2019s history. In light of this, our previous FY23F PLF assumption of 79% appears too conservative, and we now raise it to 83%, while we also raise PLF assumptions for FY24-25F from 79-80% previously to 82%.",
      "Anecdotally, Singapore is seeing strong inflows of foreign professionals, while the F1 race event scheduled for 30 Sep to 2 Oct this year could draw as many as 35k tourists, with hotel room rates already spiking. Separately, the line-up of MICE events in 2H22F could further boost inbound travel into Singapore. These include major international events, such as Food and Hotel Asia \u2013 Food & Beverage (5-8 Sep) and Food and Hotel Asia (25-28 Oct), with each expected by the Singapore Tourism Board to attract more than 30,000 physical attendees.",
      "Cargo yields are also likely to remain elevated, especially between Europe and North East Asia, due to the avoidance of Russian airspace.",
      "We have raised our 2022 year-end target price for SIA from S$5.89 to S$6.10, still based on an unchanged target P/B multiple of 0.95x (mean since 2011), applied to the end-FY23F adjusted BVPS. We are applying the P/B mean to derive our target price for SIA (and not any higher), as we have already reflected the strong near-term outlook into our earnings forecasts and book values for SIA. Our target price has been increased because we have raised our FY23-25F core net profit forecasts for SIA by 55-66%. We upgrade our call on SIA from Hold to ADD, as we expect SIA to surprise the market with very strong FY23F earnings. Our FY23F core net profit forecasts for SIA are 62% above Bloomberg consensus.",
      "Key downside risks include the potential for oil prices to surprise on the upside in the event of negative geopolitical developments, and more competition as and when other airlines are able to redeploy more of their fleet."

      "SIA (SGX:C6L)\u2019s 1QFY23 (1 Apr 2022 to 30 Jun 2022) revenue tripled y-o-y or 58.2% q-o-q to S$3.9b, supported by strong travel demand following Singapore\u2019s full openings since Apr 2022.",
      "Passenger flown revenue jumped 119.3% q-o-q to S$2.7b, boosted by a 126.7% q-o-q growth in traffic. On the other hand, cargo flown revenue fell marginally by 1.5% q-o-q to S$1.1b, impacted by the lockdowns in China.",
      "Operating expenditure was more than doubled y-o-y to S$3.4b as both net fuel cost (more than tripled y-o-y due to higher fuel prices and flight activities) and non-fuel expenditure (+62.5% y-o-y) increased. Consequently, operating income and net income turned into profit of S$556.4m and S$370.4m respectively, above our expectations.",

      "Scoot, which is SIA\u2019s low-cost carrier, remained in an operating loss of S$51.9m but narrowed by S$82.6m q-o-q as capacity recovery for Scoot\u2019s key markets such as Southeast Asia was catching up.",

      "Singapore Airlines (SIA)\u2019s 1QFY23 net profit of S$370m came in above expectations at 27% of our full-year forecast. 1QFY23 operating profit of S$556m was the second-highest quarterly profit in SIA\u2019s history.",
      "We raise our FY23 net profit forecast for SIA from S$1.35b previously to S$1.85b, a level not seen in the past decade. Note that this level of profitability should not be taken as the norm and SIA\u2019s current valuation is stretched.",
      "Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)\u2019s 1QFY23 net profit of S$370m (4QFY22: S$210m loss) came in above expectations, at 27% of our FY23 full-year forecast but 96% of consensus\u2019. The upbeat 1QFY23 earnings performance was mainly attributable to the steeper-than-expected pax volume recovery and strong pax yields, with their positive impact further amplified by SIA\u2019s high operating leverage.",
      "SIA also benefited from a favourable fuel hedge gain of S$202m (pre-tax) in 1QFY23. Excluding the fuel hedge gain, SIA\u2019s 1QFY23 net profit was still a positive S$202m, vs the S$303m net loss a quarter ago.",
      "Revenue rose 58% q-o-q, driven by the passenger business. Pax flown rose 119.3% q-o-q to S$2,676m in 1QFY23, driven by a 126.7% q-o-q growth in pax volume. Pax yield moderated slightly to 11.7 cents per passenger-km in 1QFY23 (4QFY22: 12.1 cents), but still at about 25-30% above pre-pandemic levels. Cargo-flown revenue fell 1.5% q-o-q to S$1,096m on weaker cargo loads (-3.6% q-o-q) due to lockdowns in China, but cargo yields stayed at an elevated level of 80 cents per tonne-km (+2.2% q-o-q), significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels of 28-33 cents.",
      "Improving operating cash surplus and balance sheet strength. SIA's operating cash surplus rose to S$1.48b in 1QFY23 (4QFY22: S$502m). This helped strengthen SIA\u2019s balance sheet. Even with all its Mandatory Convertible Bonds (MCBs) treated as debt, SIA\u2019s net gearing would be near 50% as at end-1QFY23 by our estimate, down from 63% a quarter ago.",
      "According to SIA, the group\u2019s pax capacity is projected to increase to around 68% of pre-pandemic levels in 2QFY23 (1QFY23: 61%) and 76% by 3QFY23. In an earlier press release, the company guided to restore pax capacity to 81% by Dec 22, with a plan to expand/restore its Japan and India networks as well as to increase flight frequencies to Los Angeles and Paris.",
      "Pax load factor already at pre-pandemic levels. Driven by the strong air travel demand, pax load factor has recovered to pre-pandemic levels, standing at 85.5% in Jun 22. We expect the pax load factor to stay upbeat through end-22, given that the next two quarters are seasonally strong (with holiday travel periods).",
      "Healthy forward sales indicating buoyant pax yields. According to management, SIA\u2019s forward sales today is very close to pre-pandemic levels. Based on the forward sales, pax yields are holding up till the end of 2022. Management noted that the company has not seen aggressive price competition at this juncture as all airlines are focusing on their own profitability recovery amid the current high level of fuel prices and inflationary pressure.",
      "Management believes cargo yields are likely to stay higher than pre-pandemic levels in the near-to medium-term as air cargo capacity remains tight on key trade lines, particularly between Europe and Asia, amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This would support the profitability of SIA\u2019s cargo business in the near-to medium-term.",
      "We believe all the above factors are paving the way for SIA\u2019s strong earnings momentum in the next two quarters. Our updated net profit projection of S$1.85b (previous: S$1.35b) is a record level not seen by SIA in the past decade.",
      "FY23 net profit forecast includes a substantial fuel hedge gain of S$910m (pre-tax) by our estimate, due to its favourable fuel hedge position (SIA hedged 40% of its projected fuel consumption till Jun 23/1QFY24 at Brent crude oil price of US$60/bbl, vs the current Brent spot price of US$110/bbl).",
      "\u2026but this level of profitability should not be taken as the norm. After the exceptionally strong FY23, we expect SIA\u2019s profitability to trend downwards in FY24-25, as:\n\nits currently favourable fuel hedge position ends in 1Q24,\ncompetition (other airlines adding/restoring capacity) drives pax yields down to more normalised levels, and\ncargo yields would also gradually return to normalised levels as the supply chain issue gets resolved.",

We expect SIA\u2019s net profit to see two consecutive years of decline in FY24 (- 26% y-o-y) and FY25 (-30% y-o-y), before stablising at a more normalised level of net profit of S$963m in FY25.",

      "Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)\u2019s 1QFY23 (1 Apr 2022 to 30 Jun 2022) core net profit of S$322m outperformed expectations as it made up 55% of our previous FY23F estimate and 96% of Bloomberg consensus. This was mainly due to the reopening of Singapore\u2019s borders from 1 Apr 2022 catalysed a doubling of SQ\u2019s RPK (revenue passenger kilometre) demand in 1Q23 from the immediately-preceding 4Q22, with PLF (passenger load factor) rising from 49% to 82.4%.",
      "The SIA group\u2019s ASK (available seat kilometre) capacity rose from 4Q22\u2019s 52% of the pre-pandemic base to 1Q23\u2019s 66% and we forecast further recovery to 73% in 2Q23F and to 79% in 3Q23F, based on SIA\u2019s guidance. These percentages are measured against the equivalent pre-pandemic quarter in CY19. A future reopening of China\u2019s borders will likely fill in the remaining gap, in our view.",
      "For now, SIA expects travel demand to be robust through to the year-end holiday period, with forward sales buoyant for the next three months to Oct 2022F. This suggests that SIA\u2019s strong 1Q23 performance will likely be repeated in upcoming quarters as SIA has promised to keep a tight rein on non-fuel operating costs.",

Our reported BVPS forecasts treat the S$9,693m mandatory convertible bonds (MCB) as wholly equity, in line with the accounting treatment adopted by SIA.",
      "We are applying the P/BV mean to derive our target price for SIA because we think that the risks and rewards of owning the stock are now in balance \u2013 with strong near-term demand, high airfares and increased market shares across most regions potentially offsetting higher operating costs from pilot salary restoration and the spike in jet fuel prices.",
      "Downside risks include higher oil prices with SIA only 40% hedged until Jun 2023F and stronger competition as other airlines ramp up their capacity restoration; we have modelled this scenario in our FY24-25F forecasts, which reflect lower earnings.",

      "Singapore Airlines 1QFY23 Results Preview - Expecting A Profitable Quarter",
      "Driven by a strong pax volume recovery and strong airfares in recent months, Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) is likely to turn in a profit in 1QFY23. We deem the street\u2019s current FY23 full-year net profit forecast of S$316m for SIA (vs our forecast of S$1.35b) conservative and due for positive surprises.",
      "Looking beyond upbeat near-term earnings, SIA\u2019s full recovery hinges on Northeast Asia, and its current valuation appears rich to us.",
      "Maintain HOLD.",
      "SIA (SGX:C6L) is scheduled to announce its 1QFY23 (Apr 2022 to Jun 2022) business update on 28 Jul 22 (Thursday) after trading hours. (See Earnings Calendar of SGX Listed Companies).",
      "The upcoming business update is the first quarterly reporting after Singapore\u2019s major border measure relaxations (effective from Apr 22) and we expect an overall positive tone from the company.",
      "As SIA is now in a turnaround situation whereby a slight variance in any of the underlying operating drivers (e.g. the speed/timing of workforce ramp-up, level of pax yields, etc) would result in significant fluctuations in profitability, we find it difficult to do a quarterly earnings estimate with good accuracy at this juncture.",
      "Our guided range of S$180m-350m is based on our best guesstimate, by referring to SIA\u2019s reported net loss of S$210m in 4QFY22 and adjusting for the rise in passenger numbers (about +150% q-o-q in 1QFY23 by our estimate) and surge in airfares in the recent months.",
      "According to Bloomberg, the street\u2019s FY23 net profit forecasts for SIA average S$316m. This compares with our FY23 full-year net profit projection of S$1.35b (S$487m if we exclude the impact of a substantial fuel hedge gain of about S$860m by our estimate).",
      "We believe the street might have underestimated the power of SIA\u2019s operating leverage and could be positively surprised by its upcoming 1QFY23 results.",
      "According to SIA, its launched pax capacity has been well booked into 2QFY23 with strong pax yields. In a recent press release, SIA guided to further re-activate its pax capacity to 81% of pre-pandemic levels by Dec 22. This is slightly faster than our projected 75% by Dec 22.",
      "Northeast Asia remains a drag. Strong near-term momentum aside, we note that the full recovery of SIA hinges on the re-openings of Northeast Asian countries (which collectively formed 26% of Changi Airport\u2019s passenger throughput in 2019), as they have been significantly lagging against the backdrop of global air travel open-up.\nChina sticking to its \u201cDynamic Zero-COVID\u201d policies.

On-arrival tests and three-day quarantine (followed by a four-day self-initiated pandemic prevention) are required. Taiwan is currently capping the overseas arrivals at 40,000 per week, representing only about 7% of Taiwan\u2019s average weekly overseas arrivals in 2019.",

Fuelled by a widened crack spread, the increase in jet fuel price was even steeper, now standing at over US$180/bbl and matching the historical high last seen in 2008. The high jet fuel prices are expected to lead airfares to stabilise at a higher equilibrium level.",
      "While we believe that the strong pent-up air travel demand being fulfilled currently and in the upcoming months would be relatively more inelastic to higher airfares, a sustained high jet fuel price (and the resultant high airfares) may eventually dampen the air travel demand in the longer term.",
      "Based on SIA\u2019s statistics, the air traffic recovery in the recent months has been mainly driven by the Americas, Europe and Southwest Pacific routes, but we note that for air travel in Singapore to recover to its full potential, traffic from/to Northeast Asia is required (China, Taiwan and Japan collectively formed about 20% of Changi airport throughput in 2019).\nChina, sticking to its \u201cDynamic Zero-COVID\u201d policies, is still in a largely locked down state today.

      "High rates of global inflation, from higher food and fuel prices, and higher global interest rates are eating into consumers\u2019 spending power, and overseas discretionary leisure travel could suffer in the future. A global recession in the future is a rising possibility, and if consumer spending falls, air cargo demand may also decline. As SIA (SGX:C6L)\u2019s competitors ramp up their capacity deployment in the future, SIA\u2019s heightened market share could fall back down to 2019 averages. This may cause the current high airfares to moderate, even if jet fuel price levels remain elevated.",
      "While SIA is 40% hedged at Brent price of US$60/bbl until Jun 2023, Brent is already at US$125/bbl and SIA is exposed to the jet fuel crack spread, which has widened from US$2/bbl a year ago to US$38/bbl now.",
      "Our analysis suggests that SIA may be keen to redeem half of its S$9.7bn MCBs within the next 2-3 years, before their yields rise from 4% to 5% p.a., as it is holding too much cash, in our view, with a net debt position of only 8.5% as at 31 Mar 2022 vs 32% as at 31 Dec 2020 (prior to the pandemic). Redeeming part of the MCBs will reduce SIA\u2019s shareholders\u2019 equity and make SIA\u2019s P/BV valuations look more expensive, which is another downside risk factor for investors to consider.",
      "We reiterate our HOLD call on SIA. Our target price for SIA is reduced to S$5.75, after cutting FY23-34F EPS forecasts for higher oil prices and applying a lower FY23F P/BV of 0.95x (mean since 2011). We previously used a higher P/BV multiple of 0.98x (+0.5 s.d.) but now adopt a lower multiple as inflation may hurt discretionary travel demand in future."

Furthermore, airfreight markets remain strong given the still-choked container shipping logistics chain; China\u2019s Shanghai region plans a release from COVID-19 lockdown from 1 June 2022F and this could stimulate air cargo volumes from the recent weakness in March and April.",

      "Air cargo demand was recently hit by weak manufacturing growth/contraction and lockdowns in China. However, air freight rates should remain strong for the rest of 2022, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict adds further strain to an already stretched global supply chain. Looking further into 2023, air freight rates will likely trend down, as supply chain bottlenecks are resolved and the air cargo capacity crunch is alleviated with the return of belly-hold cargo capacity. Nonetheless, they should stay above pre-pandemic levels given fundamental changes accelerated by the pandemic, like the advent of e-commerce.",
      "SIA is more insulated than its peers in an inflationary environment because of its fuel hedging position and cost transformation efforts. Singapore jet fuel prices surged dramatically in 2022 and are currently 60%-70% above pre-crisis levels at US$130-140 per bbl after peaking at US$150 per bbl in early May 2022. This is certainly problematic for airlines, given that jet fuel typically accounts for 20%-30% of total operating costs. On a positive note, SIA will be less impacted than most peers in the region, given a slight improvement in its fuel efficiency (younger fleet), and the airline has hedged about 40% of its projected jet fuel consumption in the short term.",
      "Furthermore, we anticipate continued improvement in SIA\u2019s ex-fuel unit costs, as passenger load factors rise, and the airline reaps the benefits of multiple cost initiatives under its new transformation programme. Initiatives include digitalisation to enhance business processes and the introduction of new technology to reduce manpower.",
      "SIA\u2019s valuation may be above its historical mean, but it is still cheaper than competitors in the region. The airline is currently priced at 1.1x FY23F P/BV, at around +0.5 standard deviation above its 10-year mean. We believe that its relatively promising recovery trajectory and medium-term outlook justify a multiple that is on par with its peers.",
      "We are lifting our FY23/24F net profit estimates for SIA to S$500m/S$1,067m to reflect the above-mentioned positive developments. Additionally, we are raising our target price for SIA to S$6.20 as we roll forward and boost our P/BV peg to 1.3x FY23/24F adjusted book value (1.2x previously, which is +1.5 standard deviation above the stock\u2019s 10-year mean P/BV), to factor SIA\u2019s brighter recovery and medium-term growth outlook.",

      "Mar 22 air traffic data at Changi Airport and operating data of Singapore Airlines beat our forecasts, even before the positive impacts from the border measure relaxations kicked in. Singapore\u2019s scraping of pre-departure test requirements for fully-vaccinated air travellers entering Singapore would further support a sector recovery.",
      "Maintain MARKET WEIGHT on the sector.",
      "Maintain BUY on SIA Engineering (SGX:S59) (new target price: S$2.90) and SATS (SGX:S58) (new target price: S$4.85) and HOLD on SIA (SGX:C6L) (new target price: S$4.85).",
      "Mar 22 air traffic statistics at Changi Airport and operating data of Singapore Airlines (SIA) came in stronger than we have expected. While the paces of recovery in the flight activities and the passenger capacity reactivation were broadly in line, surprise mainly came from the passenger volume.",
      "Changi airport passenger volume rose 62.2% m-o-m to 1,140,000 in Mar 22, which stood 19.2% of the pre-COVID-19 (Jan 20) level. National carrier SIA saw its passenger load rising 61.2% m-o-m in Mar 22, on the back of a 15.7% m-o-m increase in passenger capacity (ASK) and a significant 15.4%pt m-o-m improvement in passenger load factor.",
      "The substantial improvement in Mar 22 operating statistics has been achieved even before the anticipated positive impacts of Singapore\u2019s recent round of border measure relaxations (effective from Apr 22 onwards) kicked in. This is a sign that reaffirms the strong pend-up demand of air travel and points to a potentially steeper-than-expected recovery trajectory for the Singapore aviation sector.",
      "Since 1 April, Singapore has scrapped the previous quota-based Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) arrangement and replaced it with a new Vaccinated Travel Framework (VTF) which allows fully-vaccinated travellers to enter Singapore free of quarantine and on-arrival tests. Last Friday (22 April), Singapore announced the further relaxation of its COVID-19 measures.",
      "From 26 April onwards, pre-departure tests are no longer required for fully-vaccinated travellers and children aged 12 and below to enter Singapore. This will further ease entry process into Singapore.",
      "According to a press release by Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) on 18 April, air passenger traffic in Singapore has reached 31% of the pre- COVID-19 levels in the week ending 17 April; this is compared with 19.2% for the whole month of March by our estimate.",
      "CAAS also guided that Singapore is on track to achieve its goal to restore over 50% of pre-COVID-19 air travel passenger volume in 2022. In its most recent update, SIA guided that it would raise its passenger capacity to 61% of the pre-COVID-19 levels by May 22, compared with 51% in Mar 22.",
      "Given the strong showing of Mar 22 operating statistics of Changi Airport and SIA and considering the further easing of travel restrictions effective from Apr 22, we have raised our FY22-24 net profit forecasts for SIA (SGX:C6L), SATS (SGX:S58) and SIA Engineering (SGX:S59) upward, to reflect a potential steeper recovery trajectory.",
      "Despite the raised FY22-24 earnings projection for the three aviation plays, our forecasts beyond FY25 are lightly touched as the stronger-than-expected recovery in the near horizon does not necessarily lead to higher longer-term earnings potential.",
      "We are still looking at FY25 as the year for the sector to see a full recovery, as some major markets in Northeast Asia (particularly China) are expected to lag behind in the trend of global opening-up.",
      "We have retained our recommendations on SATS, SIA Engineering and SIA, with target prices uplifted by 4.3%, 3.6% and 1.0% respectively.",
      "SIAEC and SATS are our preferred proxies to ride the sector recovery. SIA Engineering's share price and SATS's share price are trading at 15.9x and 18.7x FY25F (normalised year) P/E, standing at 1.9 standard deviation and 0.4 standard deviation below their FY14-19 (pre-COVID-19 years) average P/E of 23.2x and 19.9x, respectively.",

      "We believe Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)\u2019s bottom line is in for a substantial improvement in FY23 (we are forecasting a slight loss of S$28m in FY23 vs about S$1.05b in net loss in FY22), driven by:\na progressive recovery in SIA\u2019s passenger business, in line with Singapore\u2019s push towards an economic reopening; and\na significant fuel hedging gain of over S$1b due to its 40% fuel hedge level throughout FY23 and the recent sharp rise in fuel prices (current Brent crude oil spot price at about US$119/bbl vs SIA\u2019s average hedge cost at US$60/bbl).",

      "SIA has adopted a proactive capacity re-activation strategy \u2013 a route/flight will be re-activated as long as the operation is cash flow positive. While this strategy will help SIA secure and grow its market share against competitors\u2019 during the recovery, it also means that the recovery in SIA\u2019s core operating profit would be more backend loaded (i.e. in FY24-25), as operating costs (capacity driven) would run relatively faster than pax revenue (pax volume driven) in the early phase of the recovery (i.e. FY23).",
      "We project SIA\u2019s net profit to rebound to S$338m and S$728m in FY24 and FY25 respectively, forming 50% and 107% of the pre-pandemic (FY19) level.",

      "Singapore Aviation - Embarking On The Recovery Journey",
      "The recovery of the Singapore aviation sector is well on track. The consensus among aviation experts indicates that the sector is likely to recover to the pre-COVID-19 level towards end-24 (FY25 for Singapore-listed players).",
      "Among the three aviation plays under our coverage, SIA Engineering (SGX:S59) (BUY, Target Price: S$2.80) is our top pick to ride the recovery, followed by SATS (SGX:S58) (BUY, Target Price: S$4.65) and SIA (SGX:C6L) (HOLD, Target Price: S$4.80).",
      "We maintain MARKET WEIGHT on the Singapore aviation sector.",
      "International Air Transport Association has forecasted global air travel passenger volume to recover to 103% of the pre-COVID-19 level by 2024, with APAC tracking slightly behind at 97% of the pre-COVID-19 level. Our conversations with the management of the three listed Singapore aviation companies (SIA (SGX:C6L), SATS (SGX:S58) and SIA Engineering (SGX:S59)) have revealed a similar timeline \u2013 the consensus is that the Singapore aviation sector is likely to fully recover by FY25.",
      "Singapore has recently joined a number of its neighbouring countries in lifting most of the restrictions on international travel. From 1 Apr 22, fully vaccinated travellers from all origins can enter Singapore free of quarantine and on-arrival tests.",
      "We deem the relaxation as a big positive development for Singapore aviation and expect it to help Singapore move closer towards its goal to restore the passenger volume at Changi Airport to at least 50% of the pre-COVID-19 level in 2022.",
      "Due to airlines\u2019 proactive capacity re-activation plans (SIA will re-activate a flight as long as the operation is cash-generative), we expect flight activities to recover relatively faster than passenger volume.",
      "As such, revenue of businesses directly geared to flight activities, including SIA Engineering\u2019s line maintenance services (about 50% of its pre-COVID-19 revenue) and SATS\u2019s ground handling services (30%) should recover faster than revenue of businesses linked to relatively lagged passenger volume, such as SIA\u2019s passenger flown revenue (80%) and SATS\u2019s infight catering revenue (40%).",
      "To ensure it can stay afloat and fulfil its significant capital commitment, SIA issued S$9.7b of mandatory convertible bonds (MCB) at the height of the pandemic. However, these MCBs would turn out to be highly dilutive if they are held to maturity and get converted.",
      "We believe MCBs have to be redeemed (and better early than late), before the earnings recovery can deliver meaningful value accretion to SIA\u2019s shareholders. The impact of COVID-19 on SIA Engineering and SATS is largely transient (manifested by goodwill/PPE impairments, one-off in nature).",
      "We expect positive news flow on air traffic recovery and Singapore\u2019s further opening up to keep sentiment towards the aviation sector buoyant in the medium term. However, we caution that SIA, the largest listed proxy to Singapore aviation, has had its valuation run beyond the justified level by traditional valuation metrics.",
      "Catalysts and risks. Some general catalysts for the aviation sector include a faster-than-expected pace of global opening up and travel relaxation. Downside risks include possibly more infectious/fatal COVID-19 variants that disrupt the global opening up process or further escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war which may dampen travel sentiment.",

      "For now, the positive impact of the VTLs to the SIA group is limited, because Singapore caps the VTL arrivals to just 3,000 daily, which is to be shared between the SIA group and other carriers, like Lufthansa, that are also operating VTL flights. In our estimate, the potential VTL traffic is less than 2% of SIA group\u2019s pre-COVID-19 passenger traffic.",

Singapore also continues to bar short-term non-VTL arrivals from most countries, except from Greater China.",

InnoTek\u2019s new CEO and Non-Independent Director Lou Yiliang (who joined at end-15) had implemented several restructuring initiatives to boost profitability, including an incentive scheme which rewards employees based on units produced per day and production yield. As a result, InnoTek managed to turn from a net annual loss of S$16.3m in 2015 to decade-high annual net profits of S$20.2m/S$16.7m in 2018/19 respectively. Meanwhile, its gross margins have also increased from 6.5% in 2015 to 24.6% in 2020. As such, InnoTek has become more resilient during economic downturns due to the initiatives. The track record of its major shareholder, the Chandaria family which is involved in the founding of Venture Corp (SGX:V03), has been underappreciated by the market. Mr Neal Chandaria has been the Chairman since 2017 to date, which are InnoTek\u2019s most profitable years.",

Trading at 2022F 8x P/E (4x ex-cash 2022F P/E), we opine this is unjustified as InnoTek has the third-best net margins and net cash position among similar Singapore peers. Coupled with the lowest P/B ratio, we believe InnoTek should be trading at a valuation nearer or on a par with its Singapore peers at 2022F P/E of 13.0x. As of 1H21, InnoTek had a net cash position of S$90m, up S$72m (+27% y-o-y) vs the level as at end-19, forming around 50% of its current market capitalisation.",

While PATMI remained in the red this quarter, it narrowed from a loss of S$1.1b in 1QFY21 to a loss of S$409m, helped by recovery in air travel, a fuel hedging gain of S$13m, mark-to-market gains of S$72m on ineffective fuel hedges (vs. S$464m losses in the same period last year) and the absence of non-cash impairment charges relating to the liquidation of NokScoot.",

The take-up rate by Temasek is comparable with the 1st tranche of ~ S$3.5bn of MCBs issued in June 2020, which saw Temasek take up ~ 95.9% of the issuance. In total, SIA has now S$9.7bn of MCBs issued.",
      "Liquidity and cash significantly bolstered.",
      "SIA reported a cash balance of ~S$7.8bn at the end of March 2021, and the MCB issuance will boost its pro-forma cash position to nearly S$14bn. Noting that the monthly cash burn for SIA has now moderated to S$100-150m per month, this strong cash position will not only help SIA navigate comfortably through the current COVID-19 crisis, but also help fund its on-going fleet renewal program to capture any market opportunities as and when international air travel does recover.",
      "No immediate dilution from MCBs but the price will eventually have to be paid.",
      "While there is no immediate dilution from these zero-coupon MCBs, the redemption price for the MCBs have been on the basis of a yield to call of 4% per annum for the first four years from the date of issuance (being June 2020), and 5% per annum for years 5 to 7 and 6% per annum for years 8 to 10. This means that the accrued annual interest cost for the S$9.7bn in the next 12 months would be ~ S$388m (~ S 13cts per share), and over S$400m in the subsequent 12 months. By year 10, the accrued interest cost for the MCBs would exceed S$7.1bn, if they are not redeemed by then.",
      "Dilution from conversion of all the MCBs would also be massive.",
      "If all the MCBs were allowed to convert at the end of year 10 (at the conversion price of S$4.84 per share), this would result in the issuance of ~ 3,479m shares, equivalent to 117% of the ordinary outstanding share capital of SIA or a more than doubling of the total number of shares in issue. This would also mean a more than four-fold increase in the total number of shares in issue compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic struck.",
      "Would be cheaper to redeem and refinance the MCBs beyond year 4 using straight debt and/or equity, if circumstances allow.",
      "Given the potential highly dilutive nature of the MCBs, we should expect that once international travel recovers more materially and the global pandemic situation has stabilized, that SIA would look to substantially redeem most or all of the MCBs, including potentially refinancing them using straight debt or even equity. These MCBs may be redeemed in part or in full, at SIA\u2019s discretion, on every six-month anniversary of the issue date.",
      "SIA expected to report deeper net losses in FY22F, though we still project the airline to return into the black in FY23F.",
      "We now project SIA to post a net loss of S$1.2bn in FY22F, as compared to S$0.2bn previously. This largely stems from the epidemiological situation deteriorating beyond our initial expectations, dampening the prospects for the formation of travel corridors between Singapore and other countries, though this is tempered by a more robust than envisaged air cargo environment. However, our FY23F forecast remains largely unchanged, with SIA posting a modest net profit of S$0.3bn.",
      "We still anticipate a meaningful uplift in air travel activity in FY23F (2022), driven by sustained momentum on the vaccination front. Singapore and key markets for SIA like Europe and North America are anticipated to pass the herd immunity threshold ( > 75-80% of population vaccinated) by late 2021, while other important markets like China, North Asia and the Pacific are expected to inoculate a critical proportion of their population by mid-late 2022. Accordingly, our current estimates point to the group\u2019s RPK climbing to 20% of pre-crisis levels in Mar-22, and 80% in Mar-23.",
      "Surge in crude oil prices will have limited near-term P&L impact; reversal of losses on hedges to bolster equity position.",
      "SIA is still in an overhedged position (close to or even above 100% in FY22F) with regards to its jet fuel consumption due to hedging contracts entered prior to the crisis. Thus, the airline will be relatively less impacted than most peers by the bull run in the crude oil market.",
      "Note that SIA had entered into various Brent hedges covering up to 55.6% of the group\u2019s projected fuel consumption at US$57-62/bbl with maturities spanning to FY24/25. As per the airline\u2019s latest sensitivity analysis, every US$1 increase in crude oil prices will translate into a S$119m increase in shareholder\u2019s equity. Hence, we should see a significant write-back to its fair value reserves over the next two years on buoyant crude oil prices.",
      "Upgrade to HOLD based on 1.2x FY23 P/B.",
      "Our target price of S$4.90 is pegged to 1.2x (+1 standard deviation of 10-year mean) adjusted FY23F book value, assuming that 100% of the MCBs are redeemed and taking into account all accrued interest costs of the MCBs as at end FY23.",

      "Supply squeeze from ongoing chip shortage; demand sustainability from capex guidance for multiple years ahead. The global chip shortage situation brought about by rising consumer demand for electronic products and supply disruption has positively impacted UMS\u2019 key client, chip-making equipment producer Applied Materials (AMAT US). Also, in the recent 2QFY21 earnings transcript released by AMAT in May 21, the semiconductor giant disclosed that customers, for the first time, provided capital spending guidance for multiple years ahead, which will be a leading indicator for demand sustainability. This augments our thesis that: the ongoing massive capex spending, and supercycle in the semiconductor industry, will bode well for UMS, lifting overall factory utilisation rates and revenue above the S$200m mark for the first time in 2021 (2010-20 average revenue was S$124m; ranging between S$110 and S$164m).",
      "TSMC, Samsung and Intel\u2019s recent comments suggest rising capital spending to last till 2023.

For instance, TSMC expects to invest US$100b over the next three years in capital spending, of which a large portion would be channelled towards chip manufacturing equipment, which AMAT\u2019s Endura platform falls under.",

The anticipated uplift in utilisation rates from fulfilling wafer-transfer modules for AMAT\u2019s Endura platform is expected to drive positive operating leverage for UMS. While there is no formal disclosure on factory utilisation rates, our channel checks suggest sequentially improving utilisation rates since 1Q20 and they continue to remain elevated. This has also been reflected in the q-o-q sales growth since 1Q20. Our current 2021 revenue estimate of S$205m implies a 24.7% y-o-y growth, translating to core net profit estimate of S$58.4m (+35.1% y-o-y).",

      "Against the immediately-preceding half-year, 2HFY21\u2019s loss narrowed by S$1.26bn (-72% h-o-h), with three-quarters of the variance explained by the swing from 1HFY21\u2019s S$564m in MTM losses to 2HFY21\u2019s S$350m in MTM gains. These MTM gains and losses arise from the fluctuation in Brent crude oil prices against the over-hedged fuel derivative position and higher oil prices in the past six months have helped to narrow SIA\u2019s losses.",

Hong Leong Asia (HLA) has been listed in the SGX since 1998 and is part of the Hong Leong Group conglomerate, one of the largest globalised corporations in Asia. Hong Leong Asia started as a building materials supplier before venturing into the diesel engine segment. Hong Leong Asia\u2019s building materials unit is one of the largest integrated players in Singapore, providing ready-mix concrete and precast concrete elements for public housing construction. Its subsidiary, Tasek, is the fourth-largest cement producer in Malaysia.

It manufactures and sells engines for trucks, buses passenger vehicles, industrial equipment and agricultural applications. Despite major disruptions due to COVID-19, China Yuchai recorded a 14.4% y-o-y increase in the number of engine units, as a result of the growth in China\u2019s agriculture segment. We expect the earnings of China Yuchai to grow by 17% y-o-y for 2021, as the growth momentum should continue in 2021 from greater buying activity in National VI(a) compliant diesel engines before its full implementation on 1 Jul 21. To tap on the EV market in the longer term, China Yuchai is developing alternative new energy solutions in new generation hybrid power, integrated electric bridge and fuel cell system.",

In the outlook statement of InnoTek\u2019s recent 2020 Annual Report dated 13 Apr 21, InnoTek highlighted that its China's Auto division is experiencing great change, with a clear shift towards electric vehicles (EV). InnoTek\u2019s precision metal components division also serves EV manufacturers. However, as the industry evolves holistically towards charging stations and infrastructure support, InnoTek will seek to deepen its value proposition with existing customers and develop new ones. This means moving beyond single-part manufacturing to parts assembly. InnoTek has secured initial orders of the latter and expects orders to increase as it establishes its foothold within the segment.",

InnoTek\u2019s new CEO and Non-Independent Director Lou Yiliang (who joined at end-15) had implemented several restructuring initiatives to boost profitability, including an incentive scheme which rewards employees based on units produced per day and production yield. As a result, InnoTek managed to turn from a net annual loss of S$16.3m in 2015 to decade-high annual net profits of S$20.2m/S$16.7m in 2018/19 respectively.",
      "Meanwhile, its gross margins have also increased from 6.5% in 2015 to 24.6% in 2020. As such, InnoTek has become more resilient during economic downturns due to the initiatives. The track record of its major shareholder, the Chandaria family which is involved in the founding of Venture Corporation (Venture), has been underappreciated by the market.

In the near term, we see little earnings impact and assume the venture will take 4-5 years to break even. In addition, an initial S$600m equity injection is manageable (raising FY21 net debt/EBITDA from 1.9x to 2x) as we expect SingTel to maintain its dividend mandate.

Demand has shown resilience despite being impacted by supply chain disruption from global lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. UMS, which provides modules and precision components for machines used to manufacture semiconductor chips, will be a beneficiary of the phenomena.",
      "Positive outlook from key client Applied Materials. About 93% of UMS\u2019s recent 2020 revenue (2019: 92%) came from Applied Materials (AMAT), the semiconductor industry\u2019s largest maker of machinery used to manufacture chips. In its latest outlook, AMAT is seeing strong order demand for its semiconductor segment, up 50% y-o-y at the midpoint of its 2QFY21 as at 18 Feb 21, due to acceleration of the economy\u2019s digital transformation. The positive view meshes with the ones provided by peers KLA Corporation and Lam Research, which lead different parts of the upstream semiconductor market.",
      "Positive operating leverage to kick in. The cyclical upturn is expected to provide further uplift to the current high factory utilisation rates ( > 70%). We believe competition would be rational among the suppliers, given the elevated capacity utilisation rates across the semiconductor industry. On the back of an expected 25% growth in 2021 revenue to S$205.0m, core net profit is estimated to jump 36% to S$59.0m, mainly due to positive operating leverage at UMS.",

We think current valuations of 10.8x forward P/E for UMS is attractive, given that the industry is riding along an uptrend. Additionally, UMS offers a respectable 2.9% dividend yield for 2021/22.",

      "Positive 2H20 results reflect strong demand. China Sunsine Chemical (SGX:QES)\u2019s 2H20 net profit rose 11% y-o-y to RMB136.4m, as revenue grew to RMB1,291m (+1%) mainly due to record sales volume of 93,556 tonnes (+9.6%), which helped offset the slip in ASPs (-9%) of rubber accelerators. The bottom line benefitted from the expansion of the gross profit margin to 27.8% (2H19: 22.9%, 1H20: 23.2%), as well as tight cost control measures. This brought 2020 net profit to RMB218.8m (-43.9%), 7% above our estimate. China Sunsine maintained its final dividend of S$0.01 per share.",
      "Gaining from higher capacity and elevated ASPs. The good set of results was attributed to management\u2019s perseverance with continued investments to expand capacity over the past few years, despite the downward trend in rubber accelerator prices. The move is now paying off, with market share for China Sunsine more entrenched, alongside rising demand for new vehicles in China. Furthermore, the ASP of rubber accelerators, the main earnings driver for Sunsine, has continued to gain ground, in tandem with aniline, the major feedstock for rubber accelerators, due to higher crude oil prices. The average price of aniline has risen an estimated 17% qtd as at 25 Feb 21 to RMB8,372/tonne, a 29% sequential increase over 4Q20\u2019s average.",
      "Good proxy for China\u2019s recovering auto sector. China Sunsine derives the bulk of its sales from China (2020: 69%, 2019: 61%), which has been strengthening since Mar 20. The Chinese economy is seeing robust growth due to government stimulus measures.",
      "Maintain BUY with an unchanged target price of S$0.58. We keep our valuation peg at 3.5x EV/EBITDA, +1 standard deviation of its 5-year average. The target price for China Sunsine implies a 2021F P/E of 9.6x and ex-cash of 4.1x. This represents a steep discount to larger peers, which are trading at 7.7x forward EV/EBITDA and 15.3x 2021F P/E.",

Revenue of S$127.1m was up 93% y-o-y while gross margin was 44% (+15ppt) as the group noted strong demand for its drama series. In 2020, GHY Culture & Media had six drama series sold and completed, while two dramas and one online short drama series were in production as at 31 Dec 20.",
      "Pipeline with larger-scale projects, higher episode count. GHY Culture & Media has another 13 dramas and one film series to be produced and released progressively through 2021-22. Management also said that drama series to be produced in 2021 are larger scale projects with a higher episode count, which will contribute to sustainable growth and earnings resilience",

GHY Culture & Media's CEO Guo Jingyu recently purchased about 0.66m shares at S$0.75/share, accumulating about 1.74m shares since the company\u2019s listing. In addition, GHY Culture & Media also has net cash of S$105m and is positioned for growth with potential M&As.",

Coupled with the second lowest P/B ratio, we believe InnoTek should be trading at a valuation nearer or on par with its Singapore peers at 2021F P/E and P/B of 13.0x P/E and 2.5x respectively.",
      "Set to benefit from recovery in China\u2019s auto sales. China has successfully contained the COVID-19 outbreak and eased most of its social distancing measures. This has led to a surge in passenger vehicle (PV) sales back to pre-COVID-19 levels. InnoTek, which has large exposure to China\u2019s automobile market (historically accounting for 30% of annual revenue), is set to benefit from 2H20 onwards.",
      "New CEO\u2019s successful restructuring initiatives and strong major shareholder backing. InnoTek\u2019s new CEO and Non-Independent Director Lou Yiliang (who joined at end-15) had implemented several restructuring initiatives to boost profitability, including an incentive scheme which rewards employees based on units produced per day and production yield. As a result, InnoTek turned from a net annual loss of S$16.3m in 2015 to decade-high annual net profits of S$20.2m/S$16.7m in 2018/19 respectively. Meanwhile, gross margins also increased from 6.5% in 2015 to 24.6% in 2020. As such, InnoTek has become more resilient during economic downturns due to the initiatives. The track record of its major shareholder, the Chandaria family which is involved in the founding of Venture Corp (SGX:V03), has been underappreciated by the market. Mr Neal Chandaria has been the chairman since 2017 to date, which are InnoTek\u2019s most profitable years.",
      "Balance sheet loaded with cash. As of end-20, InnoTek had a net cash position of S$92m, up S$72m (+28% y-o-y) vs the level as at end-19, forming 57% of its current market capitalisation.",

This was mainly carried out in 4Q20 and Jan 20 where Food Empire bought back a total of around 3.0m shares for a consideration of about S$2.0m, potentially signalling a strong confidence in its 2021 business outlook.",
      "Compelling valuation. Food Empire trades at an undemanding valuation of 11x 2021F P/E, a significant discount to peers\u2019 average of about 25x 2021F P/E despite its growing presence in the Vietnam market and leading position in its core markets in Eastern Europe.",
      "2020 earnings growth amid COVID-19 pandemic reflects resilient product offering and strong brand equity. Given the low price, relatively inelastic and consumer-staple nature of its products, Food Empire is likely to be more resilient and sheltered from an economic slowdown, in our view. Additionally, we highlight that in spite of the weaker ruble against the US dollar, the group has managed to mitigate some of the adverse impact on the bottom-line through ASP hikes and cost management. We are encouraged by Food Empire\u2019s core earnings (ex foreign exchange) growth in 2020 at 14% y-o-y despite stringent lockdowns in 2Q20. We believe this is a testament to its strong brand equity in its core markets that have been developed over many years.",

Instead news flow centres on new variants of COVID-19 and even restrictions on SIA\u2019s flights to Hong Kong. We now believe border openings would likely be pushed back to late-3Q21 at best and even then it will likely be gradual. Under such a scenario, SIA could even tap into the additional S$6.2b in mandatory convertible bonds, a scenario which the market has not factored in. We have assumed that SIA\u2019s pax traffic for FY22 would rebound by 1,100% and amount to 25% of pre-COVID-19 levels. There is downside risk to this estimate. For now, we continue to value SIA at S$4.47, or 1x FY22 & FY23\u2019s average book value.",

Credit costs are also expected to be at the lower end of guidance of 100-130bp over the two-year period (2020: 67bp).

We view this positively as it will allow SingTel to stack a new business segment to help drive future earnings growth and diversify from its key telecoms mature assets. In the near term, we see little earnings impact and assume the venture will take 4-5 years to break even. In addition, an initial S$600m equity injection is manageable (raising FY21 net debt/EBITDA from 1.9x to 2x) as we expect SingTel to maintain its dividend mandate. We value the digital banking licence win at 4 cents (or 2% of market capitalisation). This is based on 1x paid-up capital, or a 30% discount to large banks\u2019 mean P/B of 1.45x.",

As the majority of the orders this year are containerships, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding\u2019s higher shipbuilding margins from 2020 will spill into 2021 and be a secular trend for the company going forward. In our estimates, about 75% of the US$1.74b order was attributable to the containerships.",

After its IPO in 2007, Yangzijiang Shipbuilding announced record orders worth US$5b but it has not seen those levels in the past 13 years. As a result, the year-to-date order wins of US$3.04b are the highest since 2008, and we rate chances for Yangzijiang Shipbuilding to exceed these levels as reasonably high, in our view.",

In addition, if we add its net cash position to the current portion of its debt investments of RMB13.6b as at end-20, this would equate to S$3.7b vs its current market capitalisation of S$5.0b.

      "Singapore Airlines (SIA) - Time To Take Profit?",
      "We downgrade Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) from Add to HOLD as the SIA's share price is merely 11% shy of its high of S$6.42 on 2 Jan 2020, just prior to the outbreak of COVID-19.",
      "Our target price for SIA for is raised to S$6 as we raise our FY22F adjusted BVPS estimate by 9% on fuel derivative gains, and raise our P/BV multiple from 0.94x to 1.06x.\u00a0",
      "The latter historical P/BV multiple is +1 s.d. above the mean since 2011, vs the mean previously, to reflect investors\u2019 willingness to pay for recovery plays.",
      "SIA's share price has rallied sharply in recent weeks due to optimism that the ongoing global COVID-19 vaccine rollouts will reopen international borders and restore global travel; the market appears to have ignored the slower-than-expected pace of vaccinations in the Europe Union and blood-clotting issues with the AstraZeneca vaccine.",
      "SIA's share price also reacted positive to news on 14 Mar that Singapore and Australia are working to open an all-purpose travel bubble by Jul 2021, which may allow vaccinated individuals to travel without quarantine restrictions.",
      "The other positive is the fact that Brent crude oil prices have rallied, particularly since OPEC+ decided on 4 Mar to substantially roll-over the Mar production cuts into Apr, and Saudi Arabia said that it will continue its voluntary 1 million barrel per day production cut for another month into Apr. While higher oil prices are usually negative for Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) under normal operating conditions, SIA had over-hedged its jet fuel requirements for FY21F and FY22F, hence SIA will book realised mark-to-market (MTM) profits in its 4QFY21F P&L from its fuel derivatives that mature in 4QFY21F, as the derivative strike prices of ~US$60/bbl are below the current Brent oil price of US$67-68/bbl.",
      "For the not-yet-matured fuel derivatives for FY22-25F, we expect SIA to book mark-to-market (MTM) gains into its FY21F B/S reserves with respect to the actual hedges against its expected future jet fuel consumption, and MTM profits on its 4QFY21F P&L with respect to the over-hedged FY22F position. As a result of this, we raise our SIA's FY22F adjusted BVPS estimate by 9% to account for fuel derivative MTM gains, reflecting current forward average Brent prices of US$65/bbl for FY22F, US$61/bbl for FY23F, US$58/bbl for FY24F, and US$57/bbl for FY25F.",
      "In addition to our 9% higher FY22F BVPS estimate, we have also increased our target FY22F P/BV from 0.94x (historical mean since 2011) to 1.06x (+1 s.d. above mean), to reflect investors\u2019 willingness to pay for recovery plays. This takes our new target price to S$6, which is only 6.5% below the high of S$6.42 on 2 Jan 2020 (adjusted retrospectively for the May 2020 rights issue), prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. This reflects SIA\u2019s strong financial position, underwritten by support from Temasek.",
      "By comparison, Cathay Pacific is still trading 20% below its early-2020 level.",
      "Upside risks include a potential quarterly profit for SIA in 4QFY21F due to MTM gains, very strong cargo demand in 4QFY21F due to the Lunar New Year rush, and likely meaningful reopening of borders from 3QFY22F.",
      "However, beyond the MTM gains, the long road to full demand recovery may temper investors\u2019 expectations and pose downside risks to SIA's share price.",
      "See SIA Share Price; SIA Target Price; SIA Analyst Reports; SIA Dividend History; SIA Announcements; SIA Latest News.",
      "Our target price of S$6 is based on a target P/BV multiple of 1.06x (+1 standard deviation above the mean since 2011), applied to the end-FY22F adjusted BVPS.",
      "To derive our BVPS forecasts, we have assumed that SIA will raise a further S$6.2bn in mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs) in FY22F, in addition to the S$3.5bn of MCBs issued on 8 June 2020. Refer to Fig6 in report attached below for SIA's equity and debt capital raising exercises since the start of the COVID-19 global pandemic.",
      "Our adjusted BVPS calculation treats half of the MCB as debt (although the accounting treatment sees it as wholly equity) because we have assumed that SIA will endeavour to redeem half of the MCBs before their 10-year maturity or will refinance them using other sources of debt. Refer to report attached below for details on target price computation."

      "Singapore Fund Flow - Banks & Aviation Led The Way In February 2021",
      "In February, the banking and aviation sectors saw the most funds inflow by institutional investors but retail investors were net sellers. In particular, Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) remained a favourite stock and its market capitalisation is now back above its pre-COVID-19 levels.",
      "Four notable stocks with institutional and retail investors taking opposing views were Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L), Thai Beverage (SGX:Y92), SingTel (SGX:Z74) and Mapletree Industrial Trust (SGX:ME8U).",
      "In the first week of March, institutional investors continued to buy financials while retail were net sellers.",
      "We note that the week with the most movement in net buys and sells was the last week of February (week of 22 Feb 21). We believe that market concerns regarding the \u201cimminent\u201d onset of inflation, given that US new export orders and order backlogs are building, coupled with the US 10-year Treasury rate heading towards the critical 1.5% level, were the key drivers of market sentiment.",
      "In our analysis of Singapore market fund flows for Feb 21, we saw that the banking and aviation sectors were among the top buys for institutional investors, but the retail market saw it differently and were net sellers for these two sectors. For DBS (SGX:D05), despite the burgeoning headaches in India (see report: DBS Group - UOB Kay Hian 2021-02-19: More Headaches From Lawsuits In India), it led as the bank with the top stock bought by institutional investors within the financials sector.",

      "Revenue slipped 2.3% y-o-y to S$328.1m, as a result of lower sales from the industrial automation (-38%) and medical (-8%) segments. The relatively more profitable semiconductor (+50.6%) segment drove the uplift in gross margin to 18.3% (2H19: 16.4%). Additionally, tight cost control measures contributed to the increase in net margin to 7.3% (2H19: 6.1%).",
      "Demand for semiconductor components remains strong. The semiconductor segment is estimated to contribute 35% of Frencken\u2019s overall sales in 2021 (2019: 18%).

Bottom-line benefitted from the expansion of gross profit margin to 27.8% (2H19: 22.9%, 1H20: 23.2%), as well as tight cost control measures.

The move is now paying off, with market share for China Sunsine more entrenched, alongside rising demand for new vehicles in China. Furthermore, ASP of rubber accelerators, the main earnings driver for China Sunsine, has continued to gain ground, in tandem with aniline, the major feedstock for rubber accelerators, due to higher crude oil prices.

      "New CEO\u2019s successful restructuring initiatives and strong major shareholder backing. InnoTek\u2019s new CEO and Non-Independent Director Lou Yiliang (who joined at end-15) has implemented several restructuring initiatives to boost profitability, including an incentive scheme which rewards employees based on units produced per day and production yield. As a result, InnoTek turned around from a net annual loss of S$16.3m in 2015 to decade-high annual net profits of S$20.2m/S$16.7m in 2018/19 respectively. Meanwhile, gross margin rose from 6.5% in 2015 to 24.6% in 2020. Thus, InnoTek has become more resilient during economic downturns due to the initiatives. The track record of its major shareholder, the Chandaria family which is involved in the founding of Venture Corporation, has been underappreciated by the market. Mr Neal Chandaria has been the Chairman since 2017, which are InnoTek\u2019s most profitable years.",

Given the low price, relatively inelastic and consumer-staple nature of its products, Food Empire is likely to be more resilient and sheltered from an economic slowdown, in our view. Additionally, we highlight that in spite of the weaker ruble against the US dollar, the group has managed to mitigate some of the adverse impact on bottom-line through ASP hikes and cost management. We are encouraged by Food Empire\u2019s core earnings (ex foreign exchange) growth in 2020 at 14% y-o-y despite stringent lockdowns in 2Q20.

In the new COVID-19 \u201cResilience Package\u201d, S$4.8b has been earmarked for public health and safe re-opening measures including the nationwide vaccination effort. Another S$5b will go towards continued support for firms and workers while the remaining S$1.2b will be allocated to specific sectors with the emphasis on sectors that are expected to continue to be badly affected by the pandemic.\nLooking forward, the Budget has allocated S$24b for economic transformation over the next three years with the broad goals being:\n\ndevelopment of a vibrant business community,\ncatalysing capital by extending risk-sharing arrangements with financial firms, and\nredesigning jobs and creating job opportunities.\nGST increase to be implemented sometime over 2022-25. DPM Heng stated that the GST increase must still happen \u201csometime during 2022 to 2025, and sooner rather than later\u201d given the onerous spending that the Government has had to undertake in the past 12 months and in the following 12 months. He noted however that S$6b has been set aside as an \u2018Assurance Package\u2019 so that the effect of the GST increase will not be felt for 5-10 years, depending on household income.\nClimate change and supporting the move to electric vehicles (EV). In a longer-term theme, Singapore has undertaken to support UN efforts on climate change.

In particular, the aviation sector\u2019s recovery will take some time with the government noting that Changi Airport\u2019s total passenger movements were only ~2% of pre-COVID-19 levels. As a result, the government will provide targeted support and extend cost relief for the aviation sector, thus costing it S$870m. In addition, for the land transport sector, a COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund will cost the Government S$133m while the arts, culture and sports sectors will receive S$45m in a package to support capability development and sector transformation.",

At the other end of the spectrum, an investment scheme targeted at large local enterprises was also announced where the government will set aside S$500m for a commercially-managed funding platform with Temasek, which will match the investment, ie S$1b in total for the fund manager to invest in non-control equity and mezzanine debt of large local enterprises.",

      "Petrol duty tax to be raised. For premium petrol, duty will be raised by S$0.15 per litre and for intermediate petrol, duty will be raised by S$0.10 per litre. A 15% road tax rebate will be provided for private cars.",

Kimly, Koufu and Jumbo Group (SGX:42R) will see marginal benefits from this, on our estimates. Based on the Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) for the services sector, we estimate local hires command 60-70% of its total workforce. The scheme is limited to local hires and is also subjected to a wage cap of S$3,600, which is approximately the average salary or lower for most of the labour-intensive jobs in the sector. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates cost savings of less than S$0.5m for each company from the JSS scheme.",

Following the government\u2019s extension of the JSS by six months to Sep 21 (i.e. an additional six months of wages coverage), we estimate that Genting Singapore (SGX:G13)s savings will be around S$19.4m. This is derived from our assumptions that 6,455 of Genting Singapore\u2019s local/PRs employees (after assuming 5% cut of local workforce in previous restructuring) with average monthly salary of S$2,500, and 30% of their salary will be supported by JSS for three months, 10% for another 3 months as Genting Singapore falls under the tourism sector.",

Based on our estimate, the extension of JSS could help to reduce SATS\u2019s staff costs by ~S$22m for FY22F (or about 2% of its opex). We have factored in staff costs to increase by 34% y-o-y in FY22F as government relief tapers.\nSee SATS Share Price; SATS Target Price; SATS Analyst Reports; SATS Dividend History; SATS Announcements.",

      "HRnetGroup (SGX:CHZ) (ADD, Target price: S$0.635) is likely to benefit from the JGI, with the government revving up the hiring of 200,000 workers in 2021. Currently, this represents 4.3% of our total permanent placement projection (8,600) in FY21F. If HRnetGroup could capture 5% of this market (10,000 permanent placements), this could see our initial projections of core PATMI in FY21F increase from S$45.8m to S$55.3m (+20.8%), or a 23.2% growth from pre-COVID-19 levels (from our previous +2.0% estimate), assuming all other variables stay constant.\nSee HRnet Group Share Price; HRnet Group Target Price; HRnet Group Analyst Reports; HRnet Group Dividend History; HRnet Group Announcements.",

Meanwhile, the extension of JSS (for tier 2 sectors: 10% wage subsidy for three months) that ComfortDelGro can qualify for under this Budget is only for its rail and taxi operations, which we believe make up only a small proportion of ComfortDelGro's workforce (the public bus segment, which accounts for the bulk of ComfortDelGro's workforce, does not qualify for JSS extension post-Mar 21).\nSee ComfortDelGro Share Price; ComfortDelGro Target Price; ComfortDelGro Analyst Reports; ComfortDelGro Dividend History; ComfortDelGro Announcements.",

      "Singapore Budget 2021 - Stronger Together",
      "Targeted support for more impacted sectors.",
      "Green effort a key focus for a sustainable future.",
      "Supportive for the domestic equity market, but key drivers are still the global COVID-19 trajectory and impact from overseas markets, given Singapore\u2019s small and open economy.",
      "In a clear sign that the government will continue to provide targeted support for sectors and companies which are still hard hit by the pandemic, the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) was extended. The current tranche will continue to cover wages up to March 2021 for most sectors.",
      "In the new budget, the JSS will be extended for sectors that continue to be hard hit, including aviation, aerospace and tourism by six months to Sep 2021. For retail, arts and culture, food services and built environment, JSS will be extended by three months to June 2021. The targeted support and extend cost relief for the aviation sector will cost S$870 million under the COVID-19 Resilience Package.",
      "A significant portion or S$4.8b of the S$11b COVID-19 Resilience Package will be channelled towards public health and safe re-opening.",
      "The transformation of our workforce will continue and the government has set aside S$24b to be allocated over next 3 years to enable businesses to transform, and this will include creating opportunities and redesign jobs for Singaporeans to develop their skills, creativity and talents. As part of the transformation, a wide range of capital will be available to start-ups and high-growth enterprises. In addition, mature enterprises will be able to tap on fund to adopt new digital solutions and embrace new technologies.",
      "A S$900m Household Support Package will provide some support to all families, with lower-to middle-income families receiving more. Groups that have been badly hit by the pandemic will also receive more long-term support.",
      "To build a nation that has the fiscal and social reserves for continued stability and progress, several measures were announced. Petrol duties will be raised with immediate effect and road tax rebates will help to offset increased costs. The government has recently unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030. This aims to create a green, liveable and sustainable nation for Singaporeans. The five broad pillars of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 are City in Nature, Sustainable Living, Energy Reset, Green Economy and Resilient Future. The government also intends to enhance charging network and promote the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs), which we discuss more below in the following section. The petrol duty was also raised with immediate effect \u2013 the first time in six years.",
      "The government will also lead the effort to issue green bonds on select public infrastructure projects. It has already identified up to S$19b worth of public green projects.",
      "The key sustainability highlight of the 2021 Budget Speech was a significant boost to efforts to accelerate the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Singapore.",
      "Electric Vehicles\u00a0are \u201cthe most promising clean-energy vehicle technology available today\u201d, Mr Heng said.",
      "The key initiatives to encourage the shift to Electric Vehicles in Singapore are:\nIncreasing the number of EV charging points to 60,000 by 2030, more than double the earlier target of 28,000 announced last year. There are currently just 1,800 EV charging points islandwide, according to a 4 January 2021 statement by Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung.\nBudgeting S$30 million over the next 5 years to support EV-related initiatives, including expanding EV charging infrastructure at private properties.\nNarrowing the price difference between EVs and conventional vehicles powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) through adjustments to vehicle taxes and rebates, incentivising buyers to switch to EVs.\nFurther discouraging the use of ICE vehicles, by increasing petrol duty rates by 10-15 Singapore cents per litre, effective immediately, accompanied by some rebates to offset the higher costs.",

      "Further discouraging the use of ICE vehicles, by increasing petrol duty rates by 10-15 Singapore cents per litre, effective immediately, accompanied by some rebates to offset the higher costs.",
      "Mr Heng had set the policy direction in his Budget speech a year ago, saying then that the government\u2019s vision was \u201cto phase out ICE vehicles and have all vehicles run on cleaner energy by 2040\u201d.",
      "We expect the latest policy measures to significantly boost the number and penetration of EVs in Singapore in the coming years. There are now just 1,430 fully electric vehicles \u2013 mainly private cars \u2013 or 0.15% of the total vehicle population of 953,340 at end-January, according to Land Transport Authority data. Of the 636,480 private cars in Singapore at end-January, just 1,270 or 0.2% are fully electric cars.",
      "In a clear sign that the government is preparing for a much greater penetration of EVs in Singapore in the coming years, Mr Ong had said in a statement last October that the initial target of 28,000 charging points would be insufficient, \u201cif we assume EVs are one-third of all private cars by 2030\u201d.",
      "The government will take the lead in mobilising capital to fuel Singapore's sustainability drive by issuing green bonds on select public infrastructure projects. It has identified S$19 billion of public sector green projects including Tuas Nexus, an integrated water and waste treatment facility.",
      "Singapore\u2019s carbon tax will be maintained at the current rate of S$5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions until 2023. The government will review the level and trajectory of the carbon tax post-2023, and announce the review outcome at next year\u2019s Budget.",
      "The GST rate increase will not be introduced in 2021, but the government added that it will likely be introduced some time during 2022 to 2025, and sooner rather than later, subject to the economic outlook.",
      "All in, the measures that the Singapore government is taking would be a supportive factor for the domestic equity market, but key drivers are still the global COVID-19 trajectory and the impact from overseas markets, given Singapore\u2019s small and open economy. We provide further details on certain sectors below from the Budget:",
      "Pre-budget, market watchers were expecting another round of property measures to cool down residential property prices, especially in view of the still weak economic outlook. As expected, there was no mention at the Budget 2021 announcement. However, we expect the local authorities to continue to closely monitor property prices in the coming months to watch out for signs of prices running ahead of market recovery.",
      "Meantime, the extension of the Jobs Support Scheme will help to provide continued support for sectors such as tourism, retail and food services, which would provide some positives for retail and hospitality REITs.",
      "The land transport sector was also flagged for additional support by Mr Heng. S$133m has been set aside to continue the earlier announced COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund. Recall that it was announced in December last year that drivers in the point-to-point (P2P) transport sector will get a higher amount of grants to offset vehicle rental fees. Eligible drivers will get S$600 per month from January to March, and S$450 per month from April to June. The COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund replaces the Special Relief Fund, through which P2P drivers have been receiving payouts since February last year.",
      "Such funds are important \u2013 indeed for ComfortDelGro (SGX:C52), its taxi operation has been the main drag in 2020, with operating loss of S$64.4m. The group\u2019s taxi fleet stood at 9,444 taxis (~60% hybrid) as at Dec 2020, which was ~12% lower compared to Dec 2019. Current utilization level is around 95%.",
      "That said, the government also announced that there would be an increase in petrol duty from 16 Feb 2021. Petrol duty rates will be raised by S$0.15 per litre for premium petrol while the rate for intermediate petrol will be raised by S$0.10 Petrol duty was last increased in 2015 when the rates for premium grade petrol and intermediate grade petrol were increased by S$0.20 and S$0.15 per litre, respectively.",
      "To offset the impact, active taxi and private hire car drivers using petrol and petrol hybrid vehicles would obtain petrol duty rebates of S$360 over four months. This is on top of a 15% road tax rebate for one year for all taxis and private hire cars using petrol. Buses using petrol will receive a 100% one-year tax rebate.",
      "For the aviation sector, the JSS will be extended further by six months from Apr to Sep 2021 but at lower wage subsidies of 30% for wages paid from Apr to Jun and 10% for wages paid from Jul to Sep. This compares to the current 50% cash subsidies of the first S$4.6k of gross monthly wages paid to each local employee.",
      "Separately, the aviation sector will receive additional S$870m of support and extended cost relief measures such as rebates on landing and parking charges, and rental reliefs for airlines, ground handling companies and cargo agents as international air travel demand remains muted.",
      "According to International Air Transport Association (IATA)\u2019s latest estimates, global passenger traffic measured by revenue passenger kilometres is not expected to return to pre-COVID-19 levels until 2024 at the earliest. As it takes time for global rollout of vaccines, we believe that the Singapore government is likely to take a measured and gradual approach to the re-opening of borders to prevent the risks of imported COVID-19.",
      "We view the extension of support measures to the aviation sector as a positive which is likely to benefit\u00a0Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L),\u00a0SATS (SGX:S58),\u00a0SIA Engineering (SGX:S59)\u00a0which benefitted from declines in their group expenditures over the past few quarters, thanks to government support schemes and cost-saving initiatives. Moreover, the government also aims to invest in on-arrival testing and biosafety systems to secure Singapore\u2019s position as a key aviation hub. The upgraded capabilities to enable safe travel could further aid SIA\u2019s recovery, in our view.",
      "Budget 2021 targets a more modest budget deficit of -2.2% of GDP this year (close to our economist\u2019s expectation of a -2.5% deficit), taking on a more prudent stance following 2020\u2019s budget deficit (13.9% of GDP, ~S$64.9bn) with an additional S$11 billion in stimulus announced. As widely expected, while support for the economy and jobs was extended, the measures in the latest budget were more targeted with continued assistance for the most impacted sectors. At the same time, the focus has also shifted towards medium term goals and sustainable fiscal priorities to enable the country to emerge stronger from the pandemic.",
      "Amongst the various initiatives announced in Budget 2021 which included a $900 million Household Support Package, the extension of the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) in a calibrated manner is reflective of policy makers\u2019 improved confidence on the recovery trajectory of the broader economy. To date, the JSS has provided meaningful support for businesses and workers during the pandemic, with over S$25bn committed to the scheme and support for more than 155,000 employers for up to 17 months. Sectors such as financial services and precision engineering, which have been relatively more resilient, did not have their subsidies extended after December 2020.",
      "While the current tranche of JSS will cover wages for most remaining sectors up to March 2021, more support was offered to firms in select tier 1 and 2 sectors that continue to be heavily impacted by the pandemic. A S$24 billion plan was also announced to support firms and workers to re-skill and adapt to the new demands of a post-COVID-19 economy.",
      "Our house expects Singapore\u2019s GDP growth to recover around 5% y-o-y this year, at the middle of the Ministry of Trade & Industry\u2019s 4% to 6% GDP growth forecast for 2021. This follows the severe -5.4% y-o-y economic contraction in 2020 due to the pandemic, which marked the worst recession for Singapore since independence. For 2021, on the back of our more constructive macro forecasts, we have upgraded our view on the financials sector and expect an improving outlook for the Singapore banking sector, which should benefit from an ongoing recovery in economic activities and vaccines rollouts which target full population vaccination by 3Q21.",
      "Overall, we see Singapore banks as indirect beneficiaries of the continued policy support for the economy and labour market, which supports market confidence and reduces concerns over cliff effects for the more impacted sectors, which should in turn translate into lower downside risks for credit costs.",
      "The call to grow infrastructure investments and engagement within the ASEAN region looks aligned with Singapore banks\u2019 regional growth plans over the medium term, and should be supportive of loans and fee income growth prospects over time. A key part of the budget speech was also spent on sustainability initiatives, the Singapore Green Plan 2030 (which includes a goal to develop Singapore into a hub of green finance and carbon services and plans by the government to issue new bonds up to S$90 billion to finance long term infrastructure projects"

      "Singapore Airlines (SIA) - Capex Pushed Forward To Future Years",
      "SIA announced its revised capex plan yesterday; the large 30-42% reduction in capex for FY21-22F is not unexpected and should not surprise the market.",
      "Reiterate ADD on SIA with a slightly higher target price of S$4.90, still based on P/BV of 0.94x (mean since 2011) against the end-FY22F adjusted BVPS.",
      "Potential re-rating catalysts include fuel derivative MTM gains in 4QFY21F that may enable SIA to deliver another narrow quarterly loss.",
      "Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) completed negotiations with Boeing on the restructuring of its aircraft orderbook, after negotiations with Airbus had been completed several months earlier, and announced the new orderbook and capex spending guidance yesterday. None of the orders had been cancelled outright, although the annual capex guidance over the next 3-4 years has been reduced, which indicates that the orderbook delivery profile will be stretched out over several more years than originally contracted.",
      "SIA's capex for the current financial year ending Mar 2021 (FY21F) has been reduced from S$5.3bn to S$3.1bn (-42%), and for FY22F from S$5.7bn to S$4bn (-30%), but capex for FY23F and FY24F have been cut by less than 10% each against the previous guidance given in May 2020.",
      "As at 9 Feb, SIA group\u2019s aircraft orderbook stands at 142 planes, i.e. 15 x A350s, 15 x 787-10s, 5 x 787- 8/9s, 31 x 777-9s, 31 x 737 MAX 8s, 29 x A320neos, and 16 x A321neos (of which 10 will be delivered by aircraft lessors and six will be delivered by Airbus directly). The new plane-by-plane orderbook delivery profile has not been disclosed.",
      "The other notable change to the orderbook was that SIA\u2019s orders for 14 x 787-10s were replaced by 11 x 777-9 orders. The 787-10s were intended for SIA mainline to serve regional and medium-haul (MH) destinations, while the 777-9s were intended to replace SIA mainline\u2019s ageing 777-300ERs on long-haul (LH) flights.",
      "SIA has 27 x 777-300ERs, and orders for 31 x 777-9s; hence the 777-9s may not only fully replace the 777-300ERs, but also potentially replace a few of SIA\u2019s 19 x A380s, of which several may be permanently retired. The 777-9s may also be used on MH missions on selected routes in between LH flights to improve aircraft utilisation.",
      "SIA retains orders for 15 x 787-10s post-restructuring, to replace the existing 8 x A330s and 5 x 777-300s on MH missions.",
      "We do not expect the market to respond significantly to SIA\u2019s announcement yesterday, as most analysts, including ourselves, would have already factored in some degree of reduced capex spending, even though SIA had not officially announced any changes to its last formal guidance on 15 May 2020.",
      "See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price; Singapore Airlines Analyst Reports; Singapore Airlines Dividend History; Singapore Airlines Announcements; Singapore Airlines Latest News.",
      "More important would be the progress of the COVID-19 vaccine rollouts across the globe, which lend hope to SIA for a gradual recovery in traffic.",
      "In the meantime, the rise in Brent crude oil prices to above US$60/bbl may very well deliver strong mark-to-market fuel derivative gains to SIA\u2019s 4QFY21F P&L."

      "Singapore Airlines (SIA) - S$4.4b In Capex Deferment Is A Key Positive",
      "SIA has finally managed to defer capex by S$4.4b, which would reduce its cash burden substantially over the next two years.",
      "More importantly, we believe that the odds of SIA exercising another S$6.2b in MCB would now be lowered. With that, equity holders will face less risk of dilution.",
      "We have thus raised our fair value multiple for SIA to 1.0x FY22 and FY23\u2019s average and derived a fair value of S$4.43.",
      "Maintain HOLD. Suggested entry price: S$4.00.",
      "Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) also stated that the reduced capex will recalibrate the rate of capacity growth over the next few years. The carrier has also coverted its order for 14 B787- 10 aircraft into 11 additional B777-9 aircraft. The latter has about 27% higher seating capacity and has slightly higher range.",
      "SIA also appears to have pushed back the B737-Max deliveries beyond FY25. With this revised capex guidance, capex commitment for the next four years would amount to S$16.9b vs S$19.1b previously.",
      "In our recent note, we highlighted that the decision to raise additional capital will be contingent upon the ability to defer deliveries. FY22\u2019s and FY23\u2019s collective capex is about S$3.7b lower than our prior estimate.",
      "On balance, we now believe that SIA will be less likely to exercise the additional mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs), or could potentially seek an extension of the July deadline to issue the additional MCBs.",
      "SIA will also have the ability to tap into the sale and leaseback market for its unencumbered assets or sell and leaseback some of the new deliveries.",
      "Factoring in S$3.1b in capex (previous assumption: S$1.7b), we now estimate that SIA would still have an organic cash burn. We estimate that SIA would still have S$3.4b in cash by year-end. SIA can also tap into another S$9.5b in Medium-Term Notes.",
      "We have assumed that pax traffic in FY22, would amount to 24% of pre-COVID-19 levels and we have also assumed 50% increase in pax yields from pre-pandemic levels for FY22. Based on this, we estimate SIA's FY22 EBITDA to approximate FY20\u2019s EBITDA at S$2.3b.",
      "Minimal changes to our earnings estimates for SIA.",
      "See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price; Singapore Airlines Analyst Reports; Singapore Airlines Dividend History; Singapore Airlines Announcements; Singapore Airlines Latest News.",

      "SIA's PATMI loss narrowed in 3QFY21.",
      "Monthly cash burn reduced to S$250m.",
      "Strong cargo performance.",
      "Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) released 3QFY21 business updates which were above our expectations. 3QFY21 revenue fell 76.1% y-o-y to S$1.1b due to continued weakness in passenger flown revenue (-95.0% y-o-y), but partially offset by higher cargo and mail revenue (+42.4% y-o-y).",
      "While PATMI remained in loss this quarter, it narrowed from a record loss of S$2.3b in 2QFY21 to a loss of S$142m in 3QFY21, helped by a net gain of S$63m on fuel hedging and fuel derivatives, lower expenditure and tax credit.",
      "Passenger traffic shrank 97.6% y-o-y for all three airlines but improved 44.7% q-o-q on the back of a 90.8% increase in capacity for 3QFY21.",
      "As of Dec 2020, SIA resumed 19% of pre-COVID-19 capacity and plans to reinstate 25% and 45% of pre-COVID-19 capacity and city links respectively by Apr 2021.",
      "Cargo continued to outperform passenger business due to strong cargo demand, airfreight capacity crunch and increased frequencies of cargo-only passenger aircraft deployment. We expect air cargo to benefit from the recovery of global economy, e-commerce and shipment of vaccines in 2021.",
      "Cargo yield could further improve given continued capacity crunch as it needs time for passenger travel to restart and to restore belly capacity.",
      "As of 31 Dec 2020, SIA\u2019s cash stood stable at S$7.1b. SIA has increased its liquidity by ~S$12.7b in 9MFY21. Cash burn has reduced from S$300m per month in 2QFY21 to S$250m per month this quarter, with near-term target to be S$200m per month as operating environment improves.",

      "Singapore Airlines - 3QFY21 Q-o-q Improvement Supports Gradual Capacity Addition",
      "While SIA\u2019s 9MFY21 results were below the street\u2019s estimates, it was above ours, and we are encouraged by the q-o-q improvement at operating and bottom-line, brought about by increased aircraft utilisation and firm yields.",
      "We believe that SIA\u2019s careful strategy of adding capacity should lead to lower losses, provided cargo demand and yields remain firm.",
      "We now value SIA at 0.9x two years\u2019 average forward book value and derive a target price of S$4.00.",
      "Suggested entry level: S$3.80. Upgrade SIA to HOLD.",
      "Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)'s 9MFY21 earnings amounted to 100% of the street\u2019s full-year estimate but amounted to 85% of our estimated ful-year loss.",
      "On a q-o-q basis, SIA registered a 32% increase in revenue due to higher aircraft utilisation and better yields, which led to a significant reduction in operating losses.",
      "Core net loss is estimated at S$205m, which was significantly lower than 2QFY21\u2019s estimated loss. However, a key variance was that SIA recognised S$350m in tax credit for the quarter and this was significantly higher than the S$295m recognised for the whole of 1HFY21.",
      "Still, we estimate that SIA was about S$220m EBITDA positive for the quarter. Book value rose S$0.14 to S$5.28, presumably due to fair value gains recognised in reserves.",
      "SIA reiterated plans to add capacity to 25% of pre-COVID-19 levels for 4QFY21 compared with 20% as at 3QFY21. While there are concerns about the potential of higher losses if load factors remain low, SIA indicated that the incremental bellyhold cargo could cover variable costs.",
      "We also believe that both pax and cargo yields are likely to remain elevated and this could aid operating cash flow to breakeven levels.",
      "SIA indicated that it will however make its decision by Apr 21. As at end-Dec 20, SIA has S$12.7b in liquid funds, S$1.4b higher q-o-q, but this was due to the issuance of S$850m in convertible bonds and another S$500m in 10- year notes.",
      "SIA also has another S$9.5b in Medium-Term Notes.",
      "We reckon that SIA was EBITDA positive for the quarter and also believe that working capital changes might have been in SIA\u2019s favour for the period as customers were extending the bookings. This would then suggest minimal outflow from ticket redemptions.",
      "Factoring in interest and lease payments, SIA however guided that it is still losing about S$250m per month and hopes to reduce cash burn to S$200m. A key uncertainty is whether SIA will exercise the remainder of S$6.2b in MCB. Given the existing credit lines, we assume that SIA would not need to do so, but this would really be dependent on ongoing discussions to defer aircraft deliveries.",
      "We lower our SIA's FY21 net loss forecast by S$130m after factoring in higher tax credits. We have however lowered our pax load factor assumptions for FY22 and now estimate losses for the year vs a profit of S$261m previously.",
      "For FY22, we estimate that pax traffic will amount to 24% of pre-COVID-19 levels.",

      "Singapore Airlines (SIA) - Another S$16bn Of Capital-Raising Headroom",

      "We reiterate our ADD call for SIA with a target price of S$4.89, based on P/BV of 0.94x (mean since 2011) against the end-FY22F adjusted BVPS.",
      "Potential re-rating catalysts include fuel derivative MTM gains in 4QFY21F that may enable SIA to deliver another narrow quarterly loss.",
      "See 3QFY21 result highlights: Singapore Airlines (SIA) - CGS-CIMB Research 2021-02-05: Narrow 3Q Loss Should Please The Market. Since Apr, Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)\u2019s quarterly non-fuel operating costs, including depreciation of ~S$500m, have fluctuated in a tight range of S$1.2bn to S$1.3bn, implying monthly cash burn of between S$233m and S$277m, or an average of S$250m.",
      "SIA stated that its target is to reduce the cash burn to S$200m per month, and the key to achieving its goal was to generate more revenue by gradually reinstating its capacity.",
      "From flying 19% of its available seat kilometre (ASK) capacity in Dec, SIA targets to fly 25% by end-Apr.",
      "Our question to SIA was whether flying at the current passenger load factors (PLF) of 10-15% was profitable. SIA\u2019s response was that it was not only covering the variable costs of its flights, but also making a positive contribution to covering fixed costs, even at mid-teens percentage load factors, because SIA has been able to remarket the belly space that was not used for the storage of passenger baggage as revenue-generating cargo space.",
      "SIA also expects that its PLFs will increase as its global network covers a greater number of cities, as that increases the options for passengers to link different city-pairs via Changi.",
      "SIA also said that it stands to benefit from COVID-19 vaccine cargoes from this quarter onwards, and that it is well-positioned to take its share of cargoes headed to Asia and the Southwest Pacific given its cold-chain handling capabilities at Changi.",
      "SIA has already raised S$13.3bn in equity and debt capital since the start of the pandemic, and is set to raise even more funding. Given the lengthy nature of the pandemic and the uncertainty of when global borders can be reopened, SIA appears to be partial towards issuing a further S$6.2bn of mandatory convertible bonds (MCB), on top of the S$3.5bn MCBs issued in Jun 2020; SIA will make its final decision in early-Apr as the MCBs cannot be issued later than 31 Jul.",
      "In addition, SIA said that it has S$10bn of unencumbered aircraft assets, against which it has the option to raise new secured financing and/or sell and leaseback (SLB). After raising S$2bn in new financing collateralised against aircraft assets in 2020, SIA has the headroom to collateralise up to an additional S$2bn of its aircraft assets without breaching its negative pledge on its Medium Term Note (MTN) programme. As such, SIA is in advance negotiations to sell (and leaseback) its aircraft to lessors, of which the headroom is S$8bn. The MTN negative pledge does not restrict SIA from performing SLB transactions.",
      "Our forecasts have incorporated the additional S$6.2bn MCB issue, which is treated as equity on the balance sheet; this is why we forecast SIA\u2019s net gearing to be only 0.9% at end-FY22F.",
      "Our target price of S$4.89 for SIA is based on an unchanged target P/BV multiple of 0.94x (mean since 2011), applied to the end-FY22F adjusted BVPS.",
      "To derive our BVPS forecasts, we have assumed that SIA will raise a further S$6.2bn in mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs) in FY22F, in addition to the S$3.5bn of MCBs issued on 8 June 2020. See details in report attached below.",
      "Our adjusted BVPS calculation treats half of the MCB as debt (although the accounting treatment sees it as wholly equity) because we have assumed that SIA will endeavour to redeem half of the MCBs before their 10-year maturity or will refinance them using other sources of debt.",
      "See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price; Singapore Airlines Analyst Reports; Singapore Airlines Dividend History; Singapore Airlines Announcements; Singapore Airlines Latest News.",
      "Potential re-rating catalysts include stronger-than-expected recovery in passenger traffic following a quick containment of the global COVID-19 pandemic once vaccines are rolled out this year and higher-than-expected cost savings at the SIA group as a result of urgent efforts to contain costs. The SIA group disclosed that it expects to deploy 25% of its pre-COVID-19 passenger airline capacity by April 2021.",
      "Downside risks include a longer-than-expected shutdown in global international travel as various countries keep their travel bans and restrictions on inbound order to prevent imported cases of COVID-19."

      "SIA is also pushing up its group ASK capacity as a percentage of the pre-pandemic ASK, from 14% at end-Dec to 25% by end-Apr; on the not-unreasonable basis that SIA can cover its variable costs or slightly more than that, operating losses in 4QFY21F may be reduced.",
      "SIA has also embarked on its new 3-year transformation programme which may help it achieve a more competitive cost structure.",
      "On the other hand, the cargo business is past its seasonal year-end peak, although it may find some support from the airfreight of vaccines.",
      "SIA noted that it is currently in advance negotiations for the sale and leaseback of various aircraft, which could raise even more cash for the airline group.",
      "With aircraft impairments already behind SIA, and global vaccine rollouts already in progress, the worst is already behind the airline industry, although for a pure international airline that is heavily reliant on transit traffic and on business travel, SIA\u2019s recovery may lag other airlines that have domestic networks, a larger proportion of leisure and/or origin-and-destination traffic.",
      "See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price; Singapore Airlines Analyst Reports; Singapore Airlines Dividend History; Singapore Airlines Announcements; Singapore Airlines Latest News.",
      "For SIA as a whole, we are forecasting that it achieves only 33% of its pre-pandemic ASK capacity in FY22F, up from 11% in FY21F, and surpassing its pre-pandemic level only in four years\u2019 time.",

      "The ongoing spread of more virulent strains of the COVID-19 virus suggests a need for investors to remain patient, as the reopening of global borders may happen more meaningfully only in 3Q or 4QCY21. With S$13.3bn in equity and debt capital already raised (see summary of SIA's equity and debt capital raising exercises since the start of COVID-19 in report below), upcoming aircraft sale and leasebacks, and the S$6.2bn of convertible bonds, SIA is in a very strong financial position."

While there is a great deal of uncertainty on the pace of traffic and load factor recovery, we believe pre-COVID-19 FY20 EBITDA offers a fair hurdle in terms of earnings prospects for FY21.

      "Orderbook wins this year have been solid, in our view. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding has outperformed our expectations with US$1.8b worth of new orders in 2020 in a tough year, given the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, the company appears to have expanded its market share in China, given that almost all of its orders in 2020 were from China clients compared to the past which saw a more even distribution of orders originating from clients in Europe, the US and Asia. We expect the company to build on this momentum in 2021 and conservatively forecast a similar level of order wins of US$1.8b. We also highlight commentary from management that global new ship-building orders declined by about 50% in 9M20 amid a depressed market, which makes the company\u2019s order wins this year all the more compelling.",
      "Expecting solid 4Q20 results. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding\u2019s 4Q20 results should be strong, given that its new order wins peaked during the quarter at nearly US$1bn . In addition, results may be bolstered by the potential of a tax write-back at the end of 2020 as its new shipyard may qualify as a \u201cNew High Tech Enterprise\u201d, thus attracting a lower tax rate of 15% vs the current 25% tax rate that Yangzijiang Shipbuilding has provisioned for. This would equate to a tax write-back of around RMB100m which we have not factored into our current forecasts.",
      "We believe Yangzijiang Shipbuilding remains a compelling stock for this year as its valuations remain undemanding, with 2021 EV/EBITDA and P/B of 2.6x and 0.52x respectively, a PEG ratio of 0.69 and net cash of S$0.22/share (or 23% of its current share price). In addition, if we add its net cash to the current portion of its debt investments of RMB13.6b as at end-3Q20, this would be equivalent to its current market capitalisation of S$3.5b.

      "It is important to remember that vaccine deliveries are in addition to all the usual cargoes carried by airfreight and come at a time when container spot shipping freight rates are at all-time highs. In other words, the airfreight of vaccines, which will likely begin from late-CY20 or early-CY21, could help bolster Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L)\u2019s cargo volumes and support airfreight rates at higher levels for longer.",
      "Optimism about the potential for COVID-19 vaccines to restore demand for transportation fuels has pushed up Brent crude oil prices close to US$50/bbl from its Apr low of US$17/bbl and the 30 Sep close of US$41/bbl. Oil markets were also positive about the decision by OPEC+ to taper its crude oil output cuts by only 0.5 million barrels per day (mbpd), compared to the earlier target of 2 mbpd.",

The potential MTM gains on the P&L will help Singapore Airlines deliver a narrower sequential core net loss during 2HFY21F compared to the 1HFY21 level as well as boost its book value per share, ceteris paribus.",
      "While higher spot fuel prices will cause Singapore Airlines to pay more for the fuel that it actually uses, the extra cost will be more than offset by the reduction in fuel derivative losses because Singapore Airlines is in an over-hedged position for FY21-22F.",
      "Previously, we had assumed that Singapore Airlines would deploy 45% of its pre-COVID-19 capacity in FY22F. In this report, we revise this down to 35% because Singapore Airlines disclosed recently that it expected to deploy 16% of its pre-COVID-19 passenger airline capacity by Dec 2020 and rising to 50% by Dec 2021, which averages 33% over CY21. However, we have not changed our already very-modest revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) demand assumptions, leading to higher load factor forecasts and reduced core net loss forecasts for the Singapore Airlines.",
      "Our target price of S$4.91 is based on an unchanged target P/BV multiple of 0.94x (mean since 2011), applied to the end-FY22F adjusted BVPS. See PDF report attached below for details on the SIA's target price derivation.",
      "See SIA Share Price; SIA Target Price; SIA Analyst Reports; SIA Dividend History; SIA Announcements; SIA Latest News.",
      "To derive our BVPS forecasts, we have assumed that Singapore Airlines will raise a further S$6.2bn in mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs) in FY22F, in addition to the S$3.5bn of MCBs issued on 8 June 2020.",
      "Our adjusted BVPS calculation treats half of the MCB as debt (although the accounting treatment sees it as wholly equity) because we have assumed that Singapore Airlines will endeavour to redeem half of the MCBs before their 10-year maturity or will refinance them using other sources of debt. See PDF report attached below for detailed assumptions used to derive SIA's target price.",
      "Potential rerating catalysts include stronger-than-expected recovery in passenger traffic following a quick containment of the global COVID-19 pandemic once vaccines are available next year and higher-than-expected cost savings at the Singapore Airlines as a result of urgent efforts to contain costs.",
      "The Singapore Airlines disclosed recently that it expected to deploy 16% of its pre-COVID-19 passenger airline capacity by Dec 2020 and 50% by Dec 2021."

      "For Dec 20, we add SingTel as a beneficiary of the digital banking licence, switching out DBS for OCBC, adding in SIA as a short idea and removing ComfortDelGro.",
      "We also add NanoFilm and BRC Asia and remove Food Empire.",
      "Our portfolio rose 11.4% m-o-m in Nov 20 but fell short compared to the FSSTI\u2019s gain of 15.8% m-o-m. Notable outperformers include Thai Beverage (+27.6% m-o-m), DBS (+23.8% m-o-m), ComfortDelGro (+22.2% m-o-m) and Frencken (+19.6% m-o-m).",
      "On the flip side, Venture Corp (-2.2% m-o-m) and Yangzijiang (-4.3% m-o-m) underperformed.",
      "Switch out DBS for OCBC, adding Singtel.",
      "We remove DBS from our picks after the stock had a stellar month in Nov 20, rising 23.8% m-o-m. In its place, we add OCBC which trades at a more attractive 2021F P/B valuation of 0.9x.",
      "OCBC\u2019s exposure to moratorium loans has also reduced significantly, from 9% to 5% of group loans, after the expiry of the relief programme in Malaysia on 30 Sep 20. Barring the MAS\u2019 interference with banks\u2019 dividend policies, we expect OCBC to provide a dividend of S$0.50 for 2021F and S$0.56 for 2022F, translating into an attractive dividend yields of 5.0% and 5.5% respectively.",
      "We also add SingTel post the announcement from MAS that its JV with Grab had been granted a digital banking licence.",
      "Remove ComfortDelGro, add SIA as a short idea.",
      "We remove ComfortDelGro to lock in gains as ComfortDelGro's share price rose 22.2% m-o-m in Nov 20.",
      "SIA has been added to our Dec 20 portfolio as a short idea as we believe that the post-vaccine euphoria is unjustified and thus believe that SIA is overvalued, even after the recent pullback. At $4.42, SIA is trading at 10.9x FY20 pre-COVID-19 EV/EBITDA, more than 2SD higher than its 5-year mean.",
      "Reshuffling mid-cap picks.",
      "We remove Food Empire and add in BRC Asia as well as newly-initiated NanoFilm.",
      "With the gradual normalisation of construction activities and sustained margins, we are optimistic of BRC Asia\u2019s recovery and expect earnings to rebound by 88% y-o-y in FY21.",
      "For NanoFilm, we believe its unique technology - which makes it the single source supplier for 90% of its top 10 customers - provides the group with a competitive edge and superior net margins compared to peers. We forecast 3-year earnings CAGR of 38.7% for 2019-22F due to bigger wallet share from its existing customers and new applications of technology.",
      "More expensive than it was pre-COVID-19.",
      "At $4.42, SIA is trading at 10.9x FY20 pre- COVID-19 EV/EBITDA and 11.4x post-COVID-19 (FY22F) EV/EBITDA. In comparison SIA used to trade at 5.2x EV/EBITDA over the past five years. Current EV/EBITDA multiple is more than 2SD above long-term mean. We value SIA at 0.9x FY22F\u2019s book value, factoring in lower losses than the street\u2019s estimates.",
      "Stock price has run ahead of foreseeable fundamentals.",
      "We believe that the euphoria following the announcement of vaccines is unjustified and opine that SIA is overvalued. For a start, we had already imputed a recovery in traffic for FY22 and had pegged fair value at 0.9x to FY22\u2019s book value.",
      "While there is a great deal of uncertainty on the pace of traffic and load factor recovery, we believe pre-COVID-19 level FY20 EBITDA offers a fair hurdle in terms of earnings prospects for FY21. With that, we have valued SIA on a pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 EV/EBITDA multiple. The enterprise value factors in:\n\nS$8.8b in rights and mandatory convertible bonds issue;\nnew convertible debt of S$850m and exercise of S$500m from a S$10b medium-term notes (MTN).",

As a percentage of group loans, the exposure was reduced from 9% to 5%. The proportion of moratorium loans secured with collateral, such as residential, commercial and industrial properties, expanded from 91% to 93%.",
      "Smooth expiry of moratorium loans in Malaysia.",
      "The bulk of the reduction came from Malaysia where moratorium loans were reduced from S$11.8b to S$1.7b, of which businesses (mostly modified repayment) and individuals requesting further relief accounted for S$1.0b and S$0.7b respectively. Within Malaysia, the exposure to moratorium loans has contracted from 53% to 8% of country loans.",
      "From 1 Oct 20, OCBC provides targeted relief extension and loan repayment flexibility only on an application and approval basis (no longer blanket and automatic inclusion).",

In the near term, we see little earnings impact and assume the venture will take 4-5 years to breakeven. In addition, an initial S$600m equity injection is manageable (raising FY21 net debt/EBITDA from 1.9x to 2x) as we expect SingTel to maintain its dividend mandate.",

      "Singapore Airlines - SIA Is More Expensive Now Than It Was 2 Years Ago",
      "While the recent debt issuance would stave off operational risks, shareholder returns are likely to be severely crimped from higher interest payments as well as low ROIC. This is especially if much of Singapore Airlines\u2019s S$10b MTN goes towards funding capex.",
      "We have also compared Singapore Airlines\u2019s enterprise value to pre-COVID-19 FY20 EBITDA, which at 10.5x, is more than 2SD to the 5-year mean. We have made similar comparisons on a trailing book value and have reached the same conclusion.",
      "Singapore Airlines is overvalued.",
      "Downgrade Singapore Airlines to SELL. Target price: S$3.80.",
      "We believe that the euphoria of SIA share price following the announcement of vaccines is unjustified and opine that Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) is overvalued, even after the recent pullback.",
      "For a start, we had already imputed a recovery in traffic for FY22 and had pegged fair value at 0.9x to FY22\u2019s book value. While there is a great deal of uncertainty on the pace of traffic and load factor recovery, we believe pre-COVID-19 level FY20 EBITDA offers a fair hurdle in terms of earnings prospects for FY21. With that, we have valued Singapore Airlines on a pre-COVID-19 and post- COVID-19 EV/EBITDA multiple. The enterprise value factors in:\n\nS$8.8b in rights and mandatory convertible bonds (MCB) issue;\nnew convertible debt of S$850m and exercise of S$500m from a S$10b medium-term note (MTN).",

      "new convertible debt of S$850m and exercise of S$500m from a S$10b medium-term note (MTN).",
      "Given Singapore Airlines\u2019s massive fund raising, we believe EV/EBITDA multiple would provide a more incisive perspective on Singapore Airlines and have factored in S$3.5b in MCB along with capitalised coupons. Based on that, Singapore Airlines would be trading at a lofty 10.5x EV/EBITDA on historical EBITDA, which on a historical basis is more than 2SD to the 5-year mean, which is clearly is unjustifiable given the carrier\u2019s massive recapitalisation.",
      "Even forward EV/EBITDA multiple at 11.0x is lofty and our net profit numbers are already higher than street estimates.",
      "In assessing this, we used trailing FY20\u2019s shareholder equity and added rights and MCB of S$8.8b and also adjusted for the theoretical conversion of MCB into shares. Based on that, Singapore Airlines\u2019s trailing book value per share would be S$4.80.",
      "However, if we factor in the asset impairment that Singapore Airlines announced in 1HFY20, book value per share would drop to S$4.43, bearing in mind that Singapore Airlines used to trade at P/B multiples of 0.8-0.9x even prior to COVID-19; a case can clearly be made that Singapore Airlines is overvalued even on a P/B basis.",
      "We believe that investors have not factored in the impact to Singapore Airlines\u2019s earnings from additional funding. ",
      "While recent debt issuance would stave off operational risks, in the event of prolonged border closures, shareholders are likely to be severely crimped from higher interest payments as well as low return on invested capital, especially if much of Singapore Airlines\u2019s S$10b MTN goes towards funding capex.",
      "We had upgraded Singapore Airlines earlier to BUY on expectations of an imminent vaccine announcement and gradual border opening. See Singapore Airlines (SIA) - UOB Kay Hian 2020-10-22: At An Important Inflection Point; Upgrade To BUY. That opportunity has passed and we now envisage downside risk to the stock.",

      "While this news does provide a clearer recovery path for international travel to resume sooner rather than later, we caution that there are still many challenges for any vaccine to be deployed globally, including\n\nmanufacturing capacity,\nlogistics,\nwillingness of the population that will accept vaccination and\nhealthcare infrastructure.",

      "It is likely that developed markets will have access to any vaccine before emerging markets as well. Given the second wave of COVID-19 we are seeing in the US and Europe, it will still take time for the pandemic to be brought under control, even with a vaccine. In fact, we believe that the recovery trajectory is bound to be the slowest among all travel segments given that many governments are likely to remain highly cautious in reopening their borders to foreign visitors.",
      "We think the inflection point for SIA will be when major markets such as China, Japan or Australia open up their borders for unrestricted travel, or when the US or EU has controlled the pandemic well enough for other countries to open up their borders to them. Hence, the travel bubble arrangement between Singapore and Hong Kong will be closely watched for its level of success.",
      "A surge in oil price, especially if it is ahead of travel demand recovery, is also something to watch out for as it would crimp any margin recovery for airlines as and when demand rebounds. In the near term, however, a rebound in oil price is positive for carriers that have a large (ineffective) fuel hedging position such as SIA.",
      "We have assumed that SIA\u2019s overall passenger traffic will gradually recover over the next 15-18 months to 80% of pre-COVID-19 levels by March 2022, or 67% of pre-COVID-19 levels by end-2021, as international borders start to open up and as COVID-19 comes under control steadily globally with the help of effective vaccines.",
      "We had previously assumed that traffic would nearly normalize by end 2021 but this has since been derailed by a resurgence of COVID-19 in Europe and the US, where daily new cases are reaching record highs.",
      "In contrast, we believe that SIA has assumed that capacity will be restored to 50% of pre-COVID-19 levels by end- 2021 for fuel hedging ineffectiveness calculations.",
      "We projected losses of S$4.5bn for SIA in FY21F and S$36m for FY22F, versus a previous forecast of a loss of S$2.2bn in FY21F and a profit of S$470m in FY22F.",
      "Based on our new assumptions, we now project SIA to record annual revenues of S$4.2bn for FY21F and S$12bn for FY22F, an operating loss of S$2.1bn for FY21F, and an operating profit of S$222m for FY22F.",
      "See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price; Singapore Airlines Analyst Reports; Singapore Airlines Dividend History; Singapore Airlines Announcements; Singapore Airlines Latest News.",
      "In addition to the recovery trajectory for passenger carriage, we have also assumed that jet fuel will average c. US$50 per barrel in FY21F and US$65 per barrel in FY22F. Given this recovery trajectory and fuel price assumptions, SIA could break even by the last quarter of 2021."

      "Much of the cash burn was due to working capital changes of S$1.2b in ticket refunds and S$1.8b in payments to trade creditors, presumably the bulk was for payment for fuel hedges.

      "The latter included S$2.3b in payments due to trade creditors and S$1.43b in debt due. To supplement its S$7b of cash and S$2.2b in credit lines, SIA is looking to sell and lease back 12 aircraft, which could ease its immediate funding woes.",
      "SIA also highlighted that some of the S$800m in current forward bookings sales might not be redeemed over the next 12 months. We sense that SIA is looking to avoid the issuance of another S$6.2b in MCB. However, this would be largely dependent on the expanded border reopening and confidence in travel.",
      "As at 1HFY21, pax flown revenue fell by S$6.7b for the group while cargo revenue rose 24% y-o-y to S$1.24b. While SIA is optimistic of continued strength in cargo traffic in the coming quarters, the carrier needs to grow its pax traffic to boost revenue. Naturally, this is contingent on border reopenings and the willingness to travel.",
      "To that extent, SIA guided for group passenger capacity to rise from pre-COVID-19 levels of 10% as at Oct 20 to 16% by Dec 20 and noted pent-up demand for travel. However, the carrier indicated it will only add capacity if it can cover variable costs, which we would estimate would imply pax load factor of at least 40%.",
      "SIA is doing all the right things to reduce cash burn and is also bolstering its liquidity. While the operating environment is highly uncertain, we believe the risks at this stage are equally weighted to the upside and downside, but any newsflow of an effective vaccine by this year-end would aid confidence in the stock. This would lead to advance bookings and boost SIA\u2019s chances to raise funds.",
      "We believe the SIA brand still commands tremendous brand loyalty, which could lead to strong pricing power when demand eventually returns. As such, we maintain BUY but with the caveat that effective vaccines are manufactured by this year-end.",

      "Singapore Airlines (SIA) - Near-Term Positives For The Next 6 Months",
      "SIA\u2019s capacity recovery trajectory remains a huge source of uncertainty, and we note that SIA\u2019s assumed trajectory is slower than ours.",
      "Still, the near-term positives include the SIN-HKG travel bubble, the air freight peak season, the reduced cash burn rate, and upcoming capital raising.",
      "Reiterate HOLD on SIA with an unchanged target price.",
      "Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) hosted an analyst-cum-media briefing in relation to the release of its 1HFY21 results last Friday. See SIA's announcements\u00a0and our result note: Singapore Airlines - CGS-CIMB Research 2020-11-09: SIA\u2019s Worst Quarter May Be Behind It.",
      "The most interesting disclosure was that the SIA group expects to deploy 16% of its pre-COVID-19 passenger airline capacity by Dec 2020, rising to only 50% by Dec 2021. This averages 33% of its pre-COVID-19 capacity during CY21, in contrast to our current estimate of 45% during FY22F (Apr 2021 to Mar 2022).",
      "Even if we assume a strong pickup in passenger airline capacity deployments for Jan-Mar 2022, it is highly unlikely for SIA group\u2019s capacity to hit our 45% assumption for FY22F. Given the uncertainties brought about by the global pandemic, it is not possible to say if SIA is too conservative, or if we are too bullish. However, there are important implications.",

Given the uncertainties brought about by the global pandemic, it is not possible to say if SIA is too conservative, or if we are too bullish. However, there are important implications.",
      "First, SIA\u2019s conservatism means that it is less likely to transfer accumulated unrealised mark-to-market (MTM) fuel derivative losses from the balance sheet to the P&L, on account of the derivatives being in excess of SIA\u2019s actual fuel requirements, and hence no longer qualifying as effective fuel hedges. This is a positive for the future earnings announcements.",
      "On the other hand, if SIA is correct in its capacity recovery assumptions, our earnings estimates for FY22F (and possibly beyond) may have to be revised lower, which is a negative outcome. For now, we have kept our assumptions unchanged as the situation is still developing and a COVID-19 vaccine, once available, may be able to change the realities for the aviation industry slowly, but surely.",
      "The Singapore-Hong Kong travel bubble is expected to start sometime this month, and we expect the demand to be reasonably good, albeit likely still lower than pre-COVID-19, as travellers will need to pay for COVID-19 tests (making short trips expensive) and because the travel bubble will largely cater for origin-and-destination travel, with transfer traffic likely to stay modest.",
      "SIA will also enjoy the normal year-end cargo boom, and it will be better-placed to capitalise on it, as from this week, it will deploy two 777-300ERs (without seats) on cargo-only flights (1-year payback to recover the retrofit cost).",
      "SIA group\u2019s cash burn has reduced from S$350m/month in 1QFY21 to S$300m/month in 2QFY21, with its end-Sep cash pile of S$7bn able to last 24 months. The cash burn will likely fall further in 2HFY21F as revenues pick up.",
      "Finally, SIA is in advanced stages of raising more cash via aircraft sale and leasebacks and additional secured debt funding. SIA also has access to S$6.2bn in Mandatory Convertible Bonds which it must issue by 31 Jul 2021 if it so chooses (SIA to decide by Mar 2021).",
      "Our target price of S$3.46 for SIA is based on an unchanged P/BV of 0.75x (pegged to - 1 standard deviation from the mean since 2011). SIA's share price is currently trading at -2 s.d. from the mean but we think that this is too onerous for SIA as we have rolled forward our valuation basis to the adjusted end-FY23F BVPS of S$4.62 in order to capture as much of the expected losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic as possible. Once a global aviation recovery becomes more certain, the market may be more comfortable with higher P/BV multiples.",
      "To derive our BVPS forecasts, we have assumed that SIA will raise a further S$6.2bn in mandatory convertible bonds (MCBs) in FY22F, in addition to the S$3.5bn of MCBs issued on 8 June 2020. As at 30 September 2020, SIA had a BVPS of S$5.14.",
      "Our adjusted BVPS calculation treats half of the MCB as debt (although the accounting treatment sees it as wholly equity) because we have assumed that SIA will endeavour to redeem half of the MCBs before their 10-year maturity or will refinance them using other sources of debt.",

      "Reiterate HOLD on Singapore Airlines, with a lower target price of S$3.46 based on P/BV of 0.75x (- 1 s.d. from the mean) on the end-FY23F BVPS.",
      "We think investors should stay on the sidelines until COVID-19 vaccines are widely available, possibly from mid-CY21 onwards.",
      "Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)'s 2QFY21\u2019s reported net loss of S$2.3bn was SIA\u2019s largest ever, coming right after SIA reported a staggering net loss of S$1.1bn in the immediately preceding 1QFY21.",
      "The reported 1Q net loss included S$127m in aircraft impairments and provision for closure costs of NokScoot but the reported 2Q net loss included substantially more exceptional items, including S$1.33bn in aircraft impairments, S$170m in goodwill write-off, S$42m in headcount rationalisation costs, S$35m impairment of SIA Engineering (SGX:S59)\u2019s base maintenance assets, etc. After stripping these out, SIA\u2019s core net loss amounted to S$719m in the 2Q, which narrowed from 1Q\u2019s S$1bn loss; the q-o-q improvement was mainly due to a lower value of MTM losses on ineffective fuel hedges transferred from the balance sheet to the P&L.",
      "In the 1Q, SIA transferred S$464m of fuel derivative losses into the P&L in relation to derivatives that were expected to be in excess of SIA group\u2019s actual fuel requirements in FY22F; in the 2Q, only S$100m in fuel derivative losses were similarly debited into the P&L.

This helped sequentially reduce SIA's core EBIT losses at the three passenger airlines.",
      "All three passenger airlines managed to reduce their quarterly core EBIT losses in the 2Q from the 1Q. SIA mainline carrier (including the cargo operations) saw its 2Q core EBIT loss narrow to S$593m from 1Q\u2019s S$667m. SilkAir\u2019s core EBIT loss reduced to S$63m in the 2Q from 1Q\u2019s S$102m while Scott\u2019s 2Q core EBIT loss narrowed to S$142m from 1Q\u2019s S$259m.",
      "As airline revenues did not change materially q-o-q and the airlines\u2019 capacity remained severely curtailed, the improved EBIT performance came largely from the reduced MTM losses as explained above.",
      "On the other hand, SIA Engineering\u2019s core EBIT loss widened q-o-q from S$9m in the 1Q to S$16m in the 2Q due to a reduction in the volume of maintenance work as airlines globally grounded most of their fleet. See report: SIA Engineering - CGS-CIMB Research 2020-11-04: Pending Changi Airport Traffic.",
      "We expect SIA\u2019s core net losses in the 2H to narrow sequentially against the 1H due to the cautious reopening of Singapore\u2019s borders to a select group of countries (including the Singapore-Hong Kong travel bubble from later this month) and the onset of the peak airfreight season in the current quarter.",
      "Furthermore, we believe that SIA likely completed the transfers of the accumulated MTM fuel derivative losses into the P&L in 4QFY20 and 1HFY21 and these should not recur in 2HFY21F while the asset impairments are also likely over, for now at least.",

      "Singapore Airlines - No Urgency (Yet) To Add SIA Shares",
      "The cautious border re-openings, and high COVID-19 cases in neighbouring countries (as well as Europe and the US) have hampered Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L)\u2019s recovery.",
      "We expect another poor operating result for SIA's Sep 2020 quarter, with at least S$1bn of impairments on its A380s and classic 777s.",
      "Maintain HOLD with a higher target price.",
      "While Singapore has largely contained its COVID-19 outbreak and is cautiously reopening its borders, there seems to be an abundance of caution among governments elsewhere that may delay the full reopening of borders to non-essential, leisure travel. Furthermore, the pandemic is seeing resurgence in some neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, and has not been effectively controlled in India, Indonesia and the Philippines, which were erstwhile the source of a lot of transfer traffic at Changi airport.",
      "Farther away, the high number of cases in certain parts of Europe and the US also prevent SIA from resuming its hub-and-spoke air transportation business model; origin and destination traffic only produce a limited number of passengers given Singapore\u2019s small size.",
      "See PDF report attached below for analysis and detailed statistics.",
      "Singapore has initiated reciprocal green lane arrangements with several countries for official and business travel without requiring quarantine, but passenger numbers are naturally low given the paperwork involved and the necessary sponsorships. Unrestricted general travel into Singapore has been unilaterally initiated with several small countries, with no quarantine and no itinerary restrictions, but the foreign countries are not reciprocating Singapore\u2019s moves, with the possible exception of Hong Kong.",
      "We think investors should stay on the sidelines on SIA shares, with key catalysts for us to be more constructive being the emergence of widely-available COVID-19 vaccines. This is not likely to be available until 1HCY21, based on World Health Organization guidance. IATA expects a full recovery of passenger demand to the 2019 baseline only in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, we expect SIA to deliver a very poor set of Sep 2020 quarter results (to be reported in Nov), with a second-consecutive quarter of 98-99% y-o-y drop in demand. SIA guided on 29 Jul that its group passenger ASK capacity \u201cmay reach less than half of its pre-COVID-19 levels\u201d by the end of Mar 2021.",
      "SIA\u2019s largest A380s (and oldest 777s) are likely to be impaired by at least S$1bn according to SIA in the September 2020 quarter results; while non-cash in nature, the impairments reflect difficulties in finding profitable employment for the A380s in the medium-term.",
      "As Brent crude oil prices did not move much from the US$40-41/bbl level between 30 Jun and 30 Sep 2020, SIA did not benefit from any mark-to-market gains on fuel derivatives in excess of its actual requirements. SIA had purchased Brent forwards for the next 5 years, with mark-to-market fuel derivative losses of c.S$2.6bn.",

On the other hand, given that international aviation requires perhaps up to 2024 before recovering to the 2019 baseline of passenger traffic, according to IATA, we think that there is no rush to invest in SIA until a COVID-19 vaccine becomes more widely available from 2HCY21 onwards, or if an effective COVID-19 drug is released. This explains our Hold rating on the stock.",
      "We have tweaked upwards our target price based on a lower P/BV of 0.75x, from 0.84x previously (still pegged to -1 standard deviation from the mean since 2011). We think that a P/BV multiple of -2 standard deviations from the mean would be too onerous on SIA, as we have rolled forward our valuation basis to the adjusted end-FY23F BVPS of S$4.84 (from the end-FY22F BVPS) in order to capture as much of the expected losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic as possible. Once a global aviation recovery becomes more certain, the market may be more comfortable with higher P/BV multiples.",
      "To derive our BVPS forecasts, we have assumed that SIA will raise a further S$6.2bn in additional MCBs in FY22F, in addition to the S$3.5bn of MCBs issued on 8 June 2020.

      "Singapore\u2019s formation of travel bubbles is likely to gain momentum in the next three months. Together with the government\u2019s proposal to provide COVID-19 travel insurance, this reduces the risk profile of travellers. We are now more positive on cargo operations rather than the recovery in pax traffic, especially from higher freight rates when the vaccine dissemination gets underway.",
      "We now value Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) at the same P/B multiple as Cathay Pacific Airlines. Upgrade Singapore Airlines to BUY.",
      "In what must be the first move by any country, the Singapore government announced yesterday that it will provide subsidies and insurance coverage for Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders who develop COVID-19 symptoms within 14 days of their return. We believe this move will boost confidence in air travel, leading to more advance bookings and improving Singapore Airlines (SIA)\u2019s cash flow.",
      "On the same day that Singapore announced the COVID-19 travel insurance, the Singapore media reported that a National University of Singapore start-up had developed a 1-minute COVID-19 breath analyser which has a greater than 90% efficacy. Singapore\u2019s Nanyang Technological University is also developing a rapid COVID-19 test which could deliver results in 37 minutes.",
      "At present, pre-departure COVID-19 test costs about S$200 in Singapore and about US$45 in Hong Kong. If such pre-departure test costs are lower, we believe this will further incentivise travel.",
      "All in all, we are encouraged by the Singapore government\u2019s efforts to open up Singapore\u2019s borders to countries with low COVID-19 infections.",
      "We believe the Singapore government will negotiate with Australia, China, Japan, Taiwan and Thailand to open similar travel corridors with mandatory COVID-19 testing.",
      "Presently, cargo operations account for almost 80% of group capacity while load factors achieved a record high of 89% in Sep 20, implying a shortage of cargo capacity. Even if more countries open their borders, we believe Singapore Airlines will continue to add more cargo capacity by:\n\nconverting some of Scoot\u2019s A320 aircraft to carry cargo; and\nutilising Singapore Airlines\u2019 older B777-300 to carry dedicated cargo.",

Scoot\u2019s reconfigured A320 can carry almost 20 tonnes of cargo and current cargo rates are at S$5-6/kg, more than double of that in the previous year. Some industry experts believe cargo rates could go up to US$10/kg once vaccines are moved via air.",

See previous report: Singapore Airlines - UOB Kay Hian 2020-08-03: 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery. The carrier had also said that it plans to cut 4,300 positions across the group, which we estimate could lead to S$0.3b in cost savings.",
      "Notwithstanding a likely second record mandatory convertible bond (MCB) issuance, we are now more positive on Singapore Airlines.

      "In Singapore, we had already opined that Singapore Airlines is likely to exhaust its S$8.8b in rights and mandatory convertible bonds (MCB) proceeds by end-FY21. This would be due to substantial working capital funding requirements as well as a dismal outlook for the winter schedule, which will commence in the third week of October. We now assume that Singapore Airlines will issue S$6.2b in MCB by end-Mar 21. This would be dilutive to equity holders.",
      "Will Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) resume passenger flights or focus on carrying cargo in 2021? Even if rapid testing is effectively rolled out, travelers could still be reluctant to travel for fear of contracting COVID-19 and related medical costs which are unlikely to be covered by travel or medical insurance.",
      "Similarly, even if COVID-19 vaccines are approved, the distribution of a vaccine could take more than a year, due to logistics and supply chain constraints. Several vaccines under development require to be maintained in sub-zero temperatures. Amid such uncertainties, we have assumed that Singapore Airlines will issue another S$6.2b in MCB by end-Mar 21 to shore up liquidity.",
      "Singapore Airlines\u2019s book value per share in FY22, post additional MCB issuance and a forecasted loss of S$758m, is estimated at S$4.40. We value Singapore Airlines at 0.8x FY22F book value, factoring in annual dilution from the MCB.",

ST Engineering also indicated that it is adding a new line for B767 conversion, which we estimate could theoretically double PTF conversion for the aircraft type. Even so, we do not expect such conversion works to offset the decline in engine and airframe repairs in 2020 or 2021.",
      "American Airlines and United Airlines have already commenced furloughing employees and this is likely to lead to further capacity cuts, which in turn will lead to lower aircraft maintenance revenue. Thus, aerospace divisions in 2H20 could see a decline larger than the 17% y-o-y (ex-M&A) decline in 1H20.",
      "On the positive side, ST Engineering has bought back 7.6m shares to date and this raises the odds that ST Engineering will defend the 10 S cents final dividend for 2020 (our fair value price dividend yield is 4.17%). See ST Engineering Dividend History.",
      "SATS (SGX:S58) is highly levered to Singapore Airlines\u2019s fortune with 45% of revenue accrued from the carrier prior to COVID-19.

      "Outside of Singapore, SATS associates in Bangalore and Beijing have similarly benefitted via their cold chain facilities. Next, a reduction in losses from associates would be vital for an earnings recovery as ASEAN and Greater China associates - including consolidated Nanjing Weizhou - contributed 68% of losses in 1QFY21. At this stage, we are unsure of the ability of associates to lower wage costs due to stricter labour laws.",

      "Aviation - SATS & ST Engineering Will Be Key Beneficiaries Of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution",
      "We are not confident that borders will reopen by end-20 and thus do not expect any improvement for SIA or SATS. However, if a vaccine is developed by year-end or 1Q21, SATS will benefit directly via the provision of critical pharmaceutical logistics and the handling for the Asia-Pacific region.",
      "Meanwhile, ST Engineering could benefit from higher maintenance works on return-to-service checks for grounded aircraft ahead of an anticipated traffic recovery. Maintain MARKET WEIGHT on the sector.",
      "Suggested entry prices for SATS and ST Engineering are S$2.75 and S$3.30 respectively.",
      "Newsflow has been generally positive on the development of vaccines with China\u2019s CNBG and SinoVac announcing plans to roll out three COVID-19 vaccines by end-20 with a combined production volume of 600m doses by 2020. While AstraZeneca has paused trials after an adverse reaction in one among the thousands of participants, the general expectation is that a working vaccine would be available by early-21. The World Health Organisation (WHO) expects mass vaccination to commence only by mid-21.",
      "The majority of Asian countries continues to impose 14-day quarantine on all arrivals. Even if leisure travels were to be allowed (such as in Japan for specific countries), travellers face the prospects of a cumulative 28-day quarantine which will likely discourage travel.",
      "While Singapore has eased travel restrictions to Malaysia, Brunei and New Zealand, it is only for essential and business travels to and fro for the first two, while New Zealand\u2019s borders remain closed. Malaysia also banned the entry of travellers from countries that more than 150,000 cases.",
      "ST Engineering (SGX:S63) has aircraft maintenance hangars in China and the US. In China, its hangars are in key hubs in Guangzhou and Shanghai and flight movements out of China have recovered to 80% of pre-Covid levels as at August, due to a rapid recovery in domestic traffic. Still, ST Engineering\u2019s biggest aerospace exposure is in the US where about 50% of aircraft is still grounded. If more Americans opt to be vaccinated, then airlines would restore grounded aircraft to service.",
      "ST Engineering will benefit from return-to-service checks for temporarily parked aircraft and more extensive flight worthiness check on airlines grounded for longer periods, although this is likely to take place in early-21 at best.",
      "Employees in the aviation and the marine sectors will benefit from an additional 7 months of payout with subsidy of 50% and 30% respectively under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS). We have assumed ST Engineering will receive about S$90m in additional JS payout for 2021.",
      "Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) could potentially exhaust its S$8.8b in rights and convertible debt proceeds by end-Mar 21 unless it manages to defer a large part of the S$2.0b in advance payments for flights. As of August, the carrier had utilised S$4.4b of the proceeds with S$2.9b used for debt repayment and S$1.1b for ticket refunds and settlement of fuel hedging contracts. However, SIA had S$5.5b in current trade-related liabilities (including S$2b in advance bookings) and S$1.6b in derivative liabilities as at end-Mar 20. Even assuming the derivative liabilities diminish in value, we estimate SIA would have at least a further S$6b in payables by end-Mar 21.",
      "SIA also had S$2.7b in short-term debt as at end- FY20 but we believe this has been fully repaid as at Aug 20.",
      "In addition, from an operating perspective, we estimate SIA would be burning S$200m-300m per quarter inclusive of lease payments for 2Q-3QFY21.",
      "We estimate SIA would have outstanding Brent hedges of 110m bbl as at 1QFY20.",
      "SATS (SGX:S58)'s Coolport@Changi is ISO certified and is the world\u2019s first centre of excellence for pharmaceutical handling. Given Singapore\u2019s status as a key transshipment hub, SATS is likely to play a significant role in the transportation and storage of vaccines to the Asia-Pacific region.",
      "SATS\u2019 Indonesian associate PT JAS is also certified to handle pharmaceutical products. IATA has called for the special air traffic rights in support of the delivery of vaccines as well as tariff relief and priority of arrival to prevent temperature excursions due to delays. IATA has also indicated that a single dose of vaccine to the entire world population would require 8,000 B747 Jumbo Jets, which is about half the global fleet of all commercial aircraft prior to COVID-19.",
      "While SIA would theoretically be the most direct beneficiary, its financial position could possibly be severely weakened prior to a global distribution of vaccines. See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price; Singapore Airlines Analyst Reports; Singapore Airlines Dividend History; Singapore Airlines Announcements; Singapore Airlines Latest News.",
      "We have also raised SATS\u2019 FY22 earnings by S$70m but still expect a full-year loss due to a steep reduction in JSS. We have factored in S$40m in enhanced JSS for FY22. We have also raised our 2021 net profit estimate for ST Engineering by 25% to S$505m.",
      "Upgrade SATS to HOLD from SELL with a target price of S$3.10 (from S$2.67). For SATS, we have raised our long-term ROIC assumption from 7.9% to 8.3%. See SATS Share Price; SATS Target Price; SATS Analyst Reports; SATS Dividend History; SATS Announcements; SATS Latest News.",
      "Maintain HOLD on ST Engineering but with a higher target price of S$3.60 (from S$3.40).

      "\nSingapore Airlines - 1QFY20 Loss Within Expectation But SIA Expects A Slower Traffic Recovery",
      "We now expect full-year losses to double our previous estimate, in part due to the guidance of S$1b in impairment for surplus aircraft as well as slower capacity growth for FY21 and FY22.",
      "The key bright spots are a doubling in pax yields, which suggests that airlines will have pricing power when traffic rebounds, as well as strong cargo yields and revenue.",
      "Another potentially bright spot is a delay in aircraft deliveries and capex.",
      "We now value Singapore Airlines at 0.85x FY21F\u2019s diluted book value and derive a fair value of S$3.64.",
      "Upgrade to HOLD. Suggested entry level S$3.20.",
      "\n1QFY21 loss was broadly in line; excluding ineffective hedges, SIA was likely to have been EBITDA positive.",
      "Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) had warned earlier that it will close out part of the its fuel hedges due to a reduction in capacity and this led to S$464m in ineffective fuel hedging. Excluding that, we estimate that Singapore Airlines would have been EBITDA positive for the year (approximately S$40m).",
      "Cargo operations were the sole bright spot and accounted for 78% of Singapore Airlines\u2019 revenue for the period, with the carrier deploying 33 of its passenger aircraft for cargo only services. Cargo yields rose a whopping 174% y-o-y in 1Q20, due to a shortage of bellyhold capacity and strong demand for personal protection equipment.",
      "Group-wide non-fuel cost fell 54% y-o-y for the period, lower than the 79% decline in revenue. The reduction was also aided by wage credits from the Job Support Scheme.",
      "Pax yields doubled for the parent airline and SilkAir, but it was still in the red as breakeven level was still at 149% vs load factors of 10.8% due to low capacity utilisation and relatively high fixed costs.",
      "After adjusting for non-cash items and factoring in lease payments, we estimate an operating cash flow deficit of about S$200m.",
      "As at 1QFY21, Singapore Airlines had S$9.6b in cash, a S$6.9b increase from 31 March. Factoring in the S$8.8b in rights issue, a repayment of S$2.0b in bridging facility, short-term loans of S$0.5b as well as S$1b in secured loans, the cash burn for the period would approximate S$1.4b (we had previously assumed that the secured loans were not included in 1QFY21\u2019s cash flow).",
      "The carrier has 19 A380\u2019s of which 5 are on operating leases. We have now factored the non-cash impairment charges in FY21\u2019s earnings estimates. Singapore Airlines guided that they have completed discussions with Airbus and discussions are currently on-going with Boeing.",
      "Singapore Airlines had previously guided for S$5.3b and S$5.7b in capex for FY21 and FY22 respectively. We now assume that capex for FY21 and FY22 would be halved from prior guidance.",
      "Singapore Airlines also guided that capacity by end-2QFY21 would likely be at just 7% of pre-pandemic levels. We have assumed that group capacity for FY21 and FY22 would be at 11.7% and 33% of pre-pandemic capacity levels.",
      "Not surprisingly, the demand outlook has worsened given increasing concerns over a second wave of infections and risk of quarantine measures. IATA estimates that traffic will only return to pre-pandemic levels by 2024. However, until COVID-19 infections drastically slow down across the globe and vaccines are widely available, confidence in travel is likely to remain muted.",
      "Singapore Airlines has until next June to decide if it would exercise the option, but secured borrowings would certainly be a cheaper funding option and would not be dilutive to shareholders. Thus, Singapore Airlines\u2019 investment merit would only be clearer as we draw into late-4Q20 and early-1Q21. If pax load factors improve to above 40%, then the odds of further Mandatory Convertible Bonds (MCB) issuance would be reduced.",
      "We raise our Singapore Airlines' net loss estimate for FY21 to S$3.3b from S$1.6b, after factoring in S$1b in impairment and lower load factors.",
      "Upgrade to HOLD with a target price of S$3.64. While, we have doubled our full-year loss estimate, we believe that most of the known negatives are reflected in the stock price. We have assumed that traffic will rebound sharply in 2HFY22 as vaccines are rolled out.",
      "We now value Singapore Airlines at 0.85x FY21F book value and have factored in the dilution from the conversion of the MCB into equity. Suggested entry level is S$3.20 or 0.75x FY21\u2019s book value.",

      "\nSingapore Airlines (SIA) - Surge In COVID-19 Cases Hampers Recovery",
      "SIA's 1QFY3/21 (April 2020 to June 2020) core net loss of S$1bn was significantly higher than our previous FY21F core net loss estimate of S$720m (consensus: S$1.9bn loss).",
      "We reverse our short-lived ADD call back to a HOLD rating as the surge in global COVID-19 cases has put paid to our hopes of a quick recovery.",
      "Our target price, still based on 0.84x P/BV on the FY22F adjusted BVPS, has been lowered to S$3.55 due to a significant widening of our loss forecasts.",
      "Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) reported a net loss of S$1,123m for 1Q21 (April 2020 to June 2020), due to an almost 100% drop in pax carried across the FSC and LCC airlines due to COVID-19 lockdowns and border closures, but partially offset by a comfortable increase in cargo revenues and profits.",
      "All three passenger airlines \u2013 SIA mainline, SilkAir and Scoot \u2013 made large operating losses, but the cargo operations delivered a S$332m EBIT, up almost 10-fold on account of higher cargo yields amid a rush of global shipments of personal protective equipment and pharmaceuticals.",
      "Aggravating the group loss was SIA\u2019s share of NokScoot\u2019s impairment on its legacy 777 planes totalling S$127m; stripping this out, the 1Q core net loss was S$1bn, which included S$464m in mark-to-market (MTM) losses on ineffective fuel hedges, but also c.S$200m in government jobs support scheme (JSS) receipts.",
      "Removing the latter two items, we end up with a 1Q loss of S$743m, or a loss of S$3bn annualised. Adding back our estimate of S$267m in full-year JSS receipts, we end up with a back-of-the-envelope core net loss forecast of S$2.7bn.",
      "We are not deducting the MTM losses booked in 1Q, because rising oil prices may actually help SIA book MTM gains in future quarters that could reverse the 1Q MTM losses. Our new core net loss forecast for FY21F is now S$2.4bn, closely matching our estimate above, and making allowance for some improvement in pax traffic over the next three quarters.",
      "Our core net loss forecasts for FY21-23F have been widened significantly, because our old assumptions on pax traffic recovery look increasingly improbable in light of the still-worrying levels of COVID-19 infections in major markets for SIA such as Indonesia, India, Australia, Hong Kong and the US, and the reluctance of countries to open their borders prematurely.",
      "We had earlier expected FY21F ASK capacity to be c.45% of the baseline in FY20, with FY22F at 75% and FY23F at 90% of the baseline. We have now revised the ASK forecasts to 10%, 50% and 70% of the FY20 baseline in FY21F, FY22F and FY23F, respectively.",
      "Long-haul travel on SIA mainline will likely take longer to recover than medium-haul travel, which in turn may take longer to recover than short-haul travel on SilkAir and Scoot. This is a major challenge for SIA, as the long-haul operations generate the biggest chunk of profits and employ the most expensive assets. SIA is undergoing an asset impairment review, and may book a S$1bn impairment on its 19-strong A380 fleet as well as additional impairments on the values of older-generation planes.",
      "SIA typically recognises only realised MTM fuel hedging gains/losses in the P&L, with unrealised MTM gains/losses booked in balance sheet reserves.",
      "The collapse in demand and the substantial cut in capacity mean that SIA does not foresee requiring the same number of oil hedges that it had contracted. The excess barrels can no longer be considered as hedges, hence the unrealised MTM gains/losses on those excess barrels can no longer be booked in balance sheet reserves. Instead, unrealised MTM gains/losses on those excess barrels must be booked into the P&L immediately.",
      "The value of the unrealised MTM gains/losses on the excess barrels is re-measured quarterly, based on the prevailing forward oil price curve, with the difference booked into the P&L. The quarterly re-measurement of the unrealised MTM gains/losses on \u2018real\u2019 fuel hedges will continue to be booked into balance sheet reserves.",
      "During 4QFY20, SIA booked S$710m in unrealised MTM losses on the fuel hedges that were expected to be in excess of its actual requirements in FY21F.",
      "During 1QFY21, SIA booked a further S$464m in unrealised MTM losses on excess hedges, which we believe comprise two separate components that were netted off:\n\nUnrealised MTM gains on excess FY21F hedges, given that Brent crude oil prices doubled between 31 March and 30 June 2020, hence requiring a re-measurement of the unrealised MTM losses that were originally booked in 4QFY20; and\nUnrealised MTM losses on the fuel derivatives that are in excess of its actual requirements for FY22F. During the 1Q, SIA revised lower its estimates for capacity restoration in FY22F, resulting in a decline in forecast oil consumption. The unrealised MTM losses on the over-hedged position with respect to FY22F was recognised in 1QFY21 by way of a charge in the P&L.\n\n",
      "Unrealised MTM gains on excess FY21F hedges, given that Brent crude oil prices doubled between 31 March and 30 June 2020, hence requiring a re-measurement of the unrealised MTM losses that were originally booked in 4QFY20; and",
      "Unrealised MTM losses on the fuel derivatives that are in excess of its actual requirements for FY22F. During the 1Q, SIA revised lower its estimates for capacity restoration in FY22F, resulting in a decline in forecast oil consumption. The unrealised MTM losses on the over-hedged position with respect to FY22F was recognised in 1QFY21 by way of a charge in the P&L.",
      "More unrealised MTM losses on the fuel derivatives can make its way into the P&L if SIA again revises down its forward capacity estimates and oil consumption forecasts. Conversely, the unrealised MTM losses can be revised lower if oil prices increase, resulting in a credit to the P&L that would boost quarterly earnings.",
      "Our target price of S$3.55 for SIA remains based on 0.84x P/BV, using 1 standard deviation (s.d.) below the mean since 2011. We have applied this multiple against the adjusted end-FY22F book value per share (BVPS) of S$4.22. See PDF report attached below for more details.",
      "Our BVPS also treats half of the S$3.5bn Mandatory Convertible Bonds (MCB) as debt (although the accounting treatment sees it as wholly equity) because we have assumed that SIA will endeavour to redeem half of the MCBs before their 10-year maturity or will refinance them using other sources of debt.",

      "Net loss of S$1,123m in 1QFY21 on revenue decline of 79% y-o-y as passenger carriage plunged 99.5% y-o-y.",
      "Singapore Airlines\u2019s current view for planning purposes is that passenger capacity may only reach half of pre-COVID-19 levels by March 2021.",
      "On-going network review may lead to material impairment of older generation aircraft, especially for the A380, which could account for c.S$1bn in impairment.",
      "Maintain HOLD as outlook remains highly uncertain.",
      "Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L)'s group revenue declined by 79% y-o-y to S$851m as passenger carriage plunged 99.5% y-o-y, offset by improvement in cargo revenue as there was strong demand for urgent movements of personal protective equipment, fresh foods and pharmaceuticals.",
      "Operating earnings fell from a profit of S$200m in 1Q20 to a loss of S$1,037m in 1Q21, which included fuel hedging ineffectiveness charges of S$464m, as the group adjusted downwards the expected rate of recovery in the international air travel market.",
      "As a result, Singapore Airlines recorded a net loss of S$1,123m, which included S$127m in expenses from the liquidation of NokScoot while a swing from tax expense to tax credit partially offset the group\u2019s losses.",
      "Singapore Airlines expects its passenger capacity by the end of 2QFY21, or September 2020, to come in at c.7% compared to pre- COVID-19 levels as green lane arrangements with selected cities in China have been established and some restrictions lifted on transit through Singapore. Agreements with other countries or regions such as Malaysia and Europe have also been agreed or are on-going. The lifting of border controls and travel restrictions however, remain at a slow pace globally.",
      "Meanwhile, the group continues to look at ways to increase its cargo capacity to meet demand, including providing cargo-only passenger flights. The strong performance of the cargo business (+173% y-o-y during the quarter for cargo yield) was mainly due to exceptional demand for emergency movements in April, coupled with a lack of supply in the market. Cargo yields are expected to moderate but remain elevated in the months ahead.",
      "Singapore Airlines is currently reviewing its network over the longer term given the COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on passenger traffic and revenue, and signalled that this is likely to lead to a material impairment of older generation aircraft, especially the A380s (15 owned, four leased), which could account for c.S$1bn in impairment charges alone.",
      "After raising S$8.8bn through its recent rights issue of equity shares and mandatory convertible bonds, and together with fresh liquidity through other debt channels, including the renewal of existing committed lines until 2021 or later and aircraft secured financing, Singapore Airlines has seen an S$11bn increase in liquidity to ride through the current crisis. Furthermore, Singapore Airlines has the option to raise another S$6.2bn in additional mandatory convertible bonds if need be.",
      "We maintain our HOLD call for Singapore Airlines, as we see its share price as fairly valued at 0.9x FY21F P/B given the expected substantial loss it is expected to incur for FY21 and that further earnings downside risks exist in the form of a slower-than-expected recovery in international air travel and/or impairment charges on the older generational aircraft in its fleet.",
      "On the other hand, if an effective COVID-19 vaccine can be developed and produced to inoculate the wider population, this could help international air travel to recover fairly quickly and drive an earnings turnaround for Singapore Airlines.",

      "The outperformance was due to a sharp S$500m (-65% q-o-q) drop in staff costs, which exceeded our expectations.",
      "Upgrade from Hold to ADD as the deeply-discounted share price may recover once Covid-19 outbreak eases; target price raised to S$4.60 (0.84x P/BV).",
      "Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) reported a core net loss of S$699m for 4QFY20 and a full-year core net loss of S$127m.",
      "SIA typically accounts for unrealised MTM hedging gains and losses on its fuel derivatives on its balance sheet and only recognises realised hedging gains/losses on its P&L. However, in 4QFY20, SIA charged S$710m in unrealised MTM fuel hedging losses from the FY21F hedge book into its P&L, representing the excess of the barrels hedged compared to the expected consumption.",
      "If we add this back to derive the \u2018actual\u2019 operating performance, SIA would have been approximately breakeven in 4QFY20 and still profitable for FY20, in part due to the aggressive cost cuts. Salary costs, for instance, fell 65% q-o-q, or S$500m, to just S$274m in 4QFY20 due to a combination of pay cuts, reduced flying allowances and voluntary/involuntary no-pay leave.",
      "Still, this does not hide the tough conditions facing the group as the combined passenger business saw RPK demand contract 23% y-o-y and yields fall 6.4% y-o-y in 4QFY20, with MI and TR in the red and SQ merely breakeven (after adding back the unrealised MTM losses). The stronger cargo yields certainly helped SQ, although this was mostly offset by lower cargo volumes.",
      "We have reduced our FY21F core net loss estimate from S$957m to S$720m as the MTM fuel hedging loss of S$710m charged into the FY20 P&L means that an equivalent value will no longer be charged into the FY21F P&L unless, of course, the Brent forward curve falls further from the end-Mar 2020 level.",
      "However, if the OPEC+ oil production cuts succeed in increasing oil prices, SIA will benefit from MTM fuel hedging gains on the over-hedged portion, which will be booked in the FY21F P&L. Meanwhile, SIA will remain fully hedged on its now-reduced FY21F fuel requirements and is therefore not expected to suffer any economic loss on this effective portion of the hedge even if spot oil prices increase. In other words, if oil prices increase, MTM fuel hedging gains may help SIA improve its FY21F P&L performance, which may surprise the market positively.",
      "There are many uncertainties, however, and we now assume that SIA\u2019s combined passenger airline business will see a 57% y-o-y RPK decline in FY21F vs. our previous -43% assumption.",
      "Yield decline assumptions also remain highly judgmental at this point but, with the SIA share price trading at 0.69x historical P/BV, below even the P/BV of 0.74x that is 2 s.d. below the mean, a lot of negative news appears to be priced in.",
      "Investors with a high risk tolerance and a one-year investing horizon can accumulate SIA for the eventual relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions and a share price relief rally.",
      "Our target price of S$4.60 remains based on 0.84x P/BV, using 1 standard deviation (s.d.) below the mean since 2011.",
      "We have applied this multiple against the end-FY22F book value per share (BVPS) of S$5.47 because we expect SIA to report losses in both FY21F and FY22F. Hence, we have used the lowest possible BVPS in our forecast period to incorporate a margin of safety.",
      "Our BVPS also treats half of the S$3.5bn Mandatory Convertible Bonds (MCB) as debt (although the accounting treatment sees it as wholly equity) because we have assumed that SIA will endeavour to redeem half of the MCBs before their 10-year maturity or will refinance them using other sources of debt.",

Scoot is expecting capacity cuts of 98% in that time period.\nSecond, SIA has seen strong cargo demand, and hence has maximised the utilisation of its freighters and even used passenger aircraft for cargo-only flights.

It expects no additional hedging activity, and no restructuring of existing hedges either.",

In the last SIA guidance released in Nov 2019, SIA said it had planned for S$6bn in capex for FY21F. But with certain project capex delayed (like IT capex) and with the renegotiation of aircraft deliveries and retrofit scheduled, the capex is likely to be lower, and SIA will release new guidance at its FY21F results on 14 May, with the analyst briefing on 15 May.",

See attached PDF report for details on calculation of SIA's ex-rights target price as well as upside and downside risks to Singapore Airlines share price.",

      "\nSingapore Airlines (SIA) - Rights Shares And Mandatory Convertible Bonds",
      "Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited has underwritten a capital raising exercise to tide Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) through the COVID-19 pandemic. This will be done through a rights issue of ordinary shares of Singapore Airlines (Rights Shares) and a rights issue of mandatory convertible bonds (Rights MCBs), raising a gross S$8.8bn.",
      "Source: Company PSR; TERP = theoretical ex-rights price, MCB = mandatory convertible bonds",
      "Up to 1.777bn Rights Shares will be issued at an issue price of S$3.00 for each Rights Share on the basis of three 3 Rights Shares for every two 2 existing ordinary shares of Singapore Airlines.",
      "The Rights Shares represents a discount of approximately 45.5% to the Singapore Airlines\u2019s last traded price of S$5.50 on 3 April 2020 and a discount of approximately 25% to the theoretical ex-rights price (TERP) of S$4.00 per Share.",
      "Below is an example of a shareholder with 1,000 existing Singapore Airlines shares:",
      "\nEvery 1000 SIA shares held, the shareholder will need to fork out \u2026.",
      "Rights Shares rights can be sold in the open market if investors do not wish to exercise them.",
      "295 Rights MCBs will be issued for every 100 existing ordinary shares to raise up to S$3.5bn. In other words, an existing shareholder with 1,000 Singapore Airlines shares can purchase S$2,950 worth of MCBs.",
      "See attached PDF report for redemption schedule of the MCBs.",
      "\nThe MCB is a zero-coupon bond converted into SIA shares at maturity or redemption by SIA.",
      "There will be no coupon interest paid. At the maturity date of 10 years, Singapore Airlines will mandatorily convert all MCBs into shares. The number of Shares to be delivered to bondholders in respect of its holding of Rights MCBs will be determined by dividing the Accreted Principal Amount of the Rights MCBs held by such Bondholder as at the Maturity Date by the Conversion Price of S$4.84, which is at a premium of 21% to the TERP of S$4.00 per Share.",
      "\nBondholders will receive 373 shares for every S$1,000 invested in Rights MCBs today.",
      "At the maturity date, the Accreted Principal Amount will be S$1,806.11 for each S$1,000 invested in the Rights MCB. This means, if an investor invests S$1,000 in MCBs today, the MCB value will be S$1,806.11 at maturity date and the investor will receive S$1,806.11 / S$4.84 = 373 new Singapore Airlines shares.",
      "\nMCBs can be redeemed early at SIA\u2019s discretion.",
      "The Rights MCBs may be redeemable at the option of Singapore Airlines in whole or in part on every six-month anniversary of the issue date at the relevant Accreted Principal Amount as at such semi-annual Date. The Redemption Price set out below has been calculated on the basis that the annual yield to call for the first 4 years from the date of issue of the Rights MCBs is 4% per annum, and the subsequent 3 years is 5% per annum and the subsequent 3 years is 6% per annum, compounded on a semi-annual basis.",
      "For example, if a bondholder invested S$1,000 in Rights MCB and Singapore Airlines redeems the whole amount early on the 4th Semi-Annual Date, the redemption price will be S$1,082.43 (108.243% x S$1,000) and the bondholder will receive 223 (S$1,082.43 / S$4.84) new Singapore Airlines shares, representing an annual compounded return of 4%.",
      "\nInvestors risk loss if SIA share price falls below the conversion price of S$4.84.",
      "If SIA share price share price falls below S$4.84 when the MCBs are redeemed, a loss will be incurred from paying a higher price to receive the new Singapore Airlines shares at the redemption or maturity date.",
      "\nThe Rights MCBs are intended to be tradable on the active market.",
      "Investors may liquidate their Rights MCBs if they do not which to exercise them. They will also be able to liquidate MCBs that they have subscribed for by selling on the active market.",

      "The proceeds from the Rights Issue and any future issue of the Additional MCBs, which will be treated as equity in the balance sheet of the Company, will strengthen the Company\u2019s balance sheet and liquidity position and enable the Company to meet its ongoing financial commitments, weathering the severe disruption to global air travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "Singapore\u2019s economy contracted 10.6% q-o-q SAAR in 1Q20, driven by sharp downturns in construction and services due to Covid-19. The Singapore government revised its official GDP forecast for 2020 downwards -- it now expects 1-4% contraction (CGS-CIMB: -2.6%).",
      "A second round of fiscal stimulus worth S$48bn (supplementing the initial S$6.4bn) was announced. See report: Singapore Strategy - CGS-CIMB 2020-03-28: Measures To Cushion Impact, Not Turnaround",

      "\nSingapore 2020 Supplementary Budget - Providing More Pain Relief",
      "The Supplementary Budget 2020 is very much about assisting sectors that have been, and will continue to be, hard hit by the COVID-19 outbreak: aviation, F&B and hospitality.",
      "With an eye on the economic damage and savings erosion that could take place if social distancing and stay-home measures persist, the budget aims to provide generous support to lower-income households and individuals.",
      "Key beneficiaries include Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) and SATS (SGX:S58).",
      "The budget is also mildly positive for the hospitality sector.",
      "Post the Singapore Budget 2020 announced on 18 Feb 20, Singapore\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister (DPM), Mr Heng Swee Keat, announced that the government would use the country\u2019s reserves for only the second time in history and allocate S$48b in a Supplementary Budget yesterday to aid an economy that has been hurt by the negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Together with the S$6.4b in the initial budget, Singapore\u2019s spending to assist the economy will total S$55b, or 11% of GDP.",
      "Key highlights from his speech include:",
      "\nHelping employers and employees.",
      "Helping those that are currently employed, the government plans to spend S$15.1b on various job and wage initiatives to support more than 1.9m local employees. Notably, these initiatives specifically target sectors that are particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 outbreak, namely the F&B, aviation and tourism sectors. This is more than twice the level of support provided during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.",
      "Another notable feature of this Supplementary Budget was the assistance provided to the self-employed, lower-income workers, job seekers and those unemployed.",
      "\nHelping businesses.",
      "Apart from flowing out the payments under the wage support scheme more quickly, the government will also support businesses by allowing them to defer tax payments for three months, increasing property tax rebates (with hotels, serviced apartments, tourist attractions, shops, and restaurants paying no property tax), rental waivers, freezing of all government charges and fees for a year, and enhancing financing schemes to ensure adequate credit is available to companies.",
      "As above, the government has particularly targeted sectors that have been hard hit by COVID-19.",
      "\nContinuing to look ahead.",
      "In order to build capabilities for the eventual recovery, S$1.9b was set aside to help businesses build long-term capabilities, eg matching S$1 for every S$2 raised by trade associations and chambers or business groups for qualifying initiatives.",
      "\nDrawing S$17b from its reserves.",
      "In an unprecedented move for unprecedented times, the Singapore Government will draw S$17b from its reserves to help fund the Supplementary Budget \u2013 this will raise the overall budget deficit for 2020 to a historically high S$39.2b, or 7.9% of GDP.",
      "\nEnhance and extend the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS).",
      "Costing the Government S$15.1b, it will co-fund 25% of the wages for every local worker (previously 8%) but notably, the sectors that have been hit hardest by COVID-19 will receive higher support: 50% for food services and 75% for aviation and tourism.",
      "In addition, the monthly qualifying wage ceiling was raised from S$3,600 to S$4,600, and the scheme will be extended for another two quarters until end-20.",
      "\nLooking after COVID-19-affected sectors.",
      "The Supplementary Budget provided a separate S$350m enhanced aviation-support package to fund measures such as rebates on landing and parking charges, and rental relief for airlines, ground handlers and cargo agents.",
      "In addition, other tourism-related industries were catered to via enhanced versions of the Jobs Support Scheme.",
      "\nDeferment of income tax.",
      "The Singapore Government announced that it would automatically defer income tax payments for companies and the self-employed for three months.",
      "\nIncreasing the rebate on property taxes while targeted sectors will not pay any property tax in 2020.",
      "The property tax rebate will be enhanced with a higher amount and to cover more properties, notably commercial properties badly affected by COVID-19, eg hotels, serviced apartments, tourist attractions, shops and restaurants, will pay no property tax for 2020.",
      "For businesses in other non-residential properties, such as offices and industrial properties, a property tax rebate of 30% will be granted.",
      "\nRental waivers.",
      "During the Supplementary Budget speech, Mr Heng noted that the government will lead by example with the National Environment Agency (NEA) giving stallholders in hawker centres managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators a three-month rental waiver, up from the one-month waiver announced last month.",
      "\nEnsuring credit lines are open.",
      "Various financing schemes, such as the Enterprise Financing Scheme-SME Working Capital Loan, Loan Insurance Scheme and the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme, will be enhanced and the Monetary Authority of Singapore will work with banks and insurers to arrive at the best form of assistance for businesses and individuals with regards to their loan obligations and insurance premium payments.",
      "\nSupporting self-employed and low-income persons.",
      "Costing S$1.2b, a new Self- Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) will be set up where eligible self-employed persons will receive S$1,000 a month for nine months. With regards to low income persons, the Supplementary Budget increases the payout received by Workfare recipients to $3,000 each.",
      "\nRamping up the Care and Support Package",
      "Ramping up the Care and Support Package (announced in Budget 2020) to around S$4.6b, which includes a tripling of the cash payout for all adult Singaporeans to between S$300-900, as well as that given to parents with young children, while parents with at least one child below 20 years old would receive S$300 instead of $100.",
      "To help needy Singaporeans with daily expenses, especially in the cost of food, grocery vouchers given to them this year will also be tripled to S$300, and an additional $100 in vouchers in 2021.",
      "\nGovernment fees and charges frozen for the next 12 months.",
      "The Supplementary Budget allows for a freeze on all government fees and charges for a year until 31 Mar 21, while all loan repayment and interest charges have been suspended for a year for graduates who have taken a government loan for their university and polytechnic studies.",
      "\nKey benefit from the Supplementary Budget is the 75% wage support",
      "Key benefit from the Supplementary Budget is the 75% wage support for employees in the aviation sector. The wage support will be capped at a monthly wage of S$4,600 and will extend till end 2020.",
      "We estimate that Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) could save between S$67-70m or an estimated 2.3% of FY20\u2019s (Apr 19-Mar 20) staff cost.",
      "Savings for SATS (SGX:S58) is estimated at about S$40m or about 4.3% of FY20\u2019s staff cost. See report: SATS - UOB Kay Hian 2020-03-27: Benefit From Government\u2019s Wage Support & Capital Infusion Into SIA; Upgrade To BUY.",
      "For SIA Engineering (SGX:S59), we estimate about S$13m or 2.7% of FY20\u2019s staff cost.",
      "\nSector expected to remain negative despite wage support.",
      "Measures directly related to the sector include the increased co-funding of wages and enhanced rental waiver. We believe the increased co-funding of wages as part of the job support scheme from 8% to 25% will help low wage and labour intensive industry, especially F&B service companies (licensed food shops and food stalls, including hawker stalls) which will enjoy a higher co-funding of 50%.",
      "For F&B service companies, staff cost accounts for approximately 17% and 30% of Koufu (SGX:VL6)\u2019s and Jumbo Group (SGX:42R)\u2019s revenues respectively. Based on the dependency ratio ceiling (DRC) for the services sector, we estimate local hires command approximately 70% of its total workforce. Based on these assumptions, our back-of-envelope calculations indicates an additional (from last round) cash grant of roughly S$7.0m (25% of 2019 earnings) and S$3.5m (30% of 2019 earnings) for Koufu and Jumbo Group respectively.",
      "Although the cost savings does help support earnings, we think it acts more as a cushion and we still expect a net negative impact to earnings from COVID-19, given that the situation has deteriorated and additional travel restrictions have been put in place.",
      "\nRental waiver to cushion higher costs.",
      "In addition, commercial tenants in government-owned facilities who qualified for the half a month\u2019s worth of rental waiver (announced in Budget 2020) will now get two months. We believe that Sheng Siong (SGX:OV8) and Koufu will be eligible given that both the companies lease a significant number of HDB shop units. Given that Koufu would likely have to pass on some of the cost savings to stall tenants in coffee shops and food courts, the main beneficiary of the scheme would be Sheng Siong, in our view.",
      "Our back-of-envelope calculations indicate c.S$2.4m (3.2% of earnings) for the 1.5 months additional waiver. Further, we estimate Sheng Siong would also receive an additional (from last round) cash grant of S$6m-6.5m, or 7.9-8.6% of 2019 earnings for the enhanced JSS. That said, these cost savings could be used to cushion the potential increase in input prices from supply chain disruptions.",
      "\nEnhanced property tax rebate of 60% for 2020.",
      "From the previously announced Budget 2020 where integrated resorts will be granted a 10% property tax rebate, this has been enhanced to a 60% rebate in the Supplementary Budget. We believe that this would be marginally positive to Resort World Sentosa\u2019s property tax, however, the potential tax rebate would unlikely be significant as it is modest compared to Genting Singapore (SGX:G13)\u2019s earnings base.",
      "\nIncome tax payment deferment.",
      "No material impact given that Genting Singapore\u2019 net cash is lush at S$3.95b (or S$0.33/share) and it does not have cashflow issues for income tax payment.",
      "\nDrivers first.",
      "A second tranche of Point-To-Point (P2P) Support package was announced, primarily supporting drivers. Drivers would receive relief of S$300 per vehicle per month till Sep 20.",
      "For ComfortDelGro (SGX:C52), the group had earlier announced further relief for an additional $10 daily rental relief, added on to its existing daily rental cuts of $16.50, with these current cuts extending until end-Apr 20. We estimate this to cost approximately S$7m-10m for ComfortDelGro. The government will waive P2P operator-licence fee for another six months though we think the cost savings is likely marginal.",
      "\nEasing fleet size down.",
      "The government will also provide up to $2,200 in special relief for each unhired taxi, though operators are strongly encouraged to pass on cost savings to drivers, such as through rental reductions and waiver of early return contract breakage costs. The government is also providing a one-time waiver of $100 outward conversion fee for private hire car owners to enjoy lower insurance premiums, easing transition to other jobs. These appear to ease fleet supply down, dealing with the demand shock in which P2P drivers have seen a sustained drop in ridership of over 20%.",
      "All in all, ComfortDelGro\u2019s taxi segment is still under pressure from the prolonged virus outbreak.",
      "\nNo property tax to be paid in 2020.",
      "Qualifying properties, such as hotels, serviced residences, retail shops and restaurants, will pay no property tax in 2020. Previously, property tax rebates were set at 15% for retail shops and restaurants and 30% for hotels and serviced residences.",
      "In addition, the government has also granted property tax rebate of 30% for offices and industrial properties.",
      "\nRebates will be neutral to S-REITs.",
      "The government has urged landlords to fully pass the rebates on to tenants, which is arguably the group suffering the brunt of the COVID-19 asures to alleviate the hardship experienced by retailers and F&B operators have a neutral impact on S-REITs, in our view.",
      "\nHospitality REITs to benefit from JSS.",
      "Staffing is a significant fixed cost which is hard to eliminate as hotel occupancies crater in the face of COVID-19 travel restrictions. Under JSS, for every local employee payroll, hotel operators will receive support for 75% of the first S$4,600 in gross monthly wages (incl. 25% base support).",
      "S-REITs, which have higher exposure to Singapore hospitality assets, and under managed contracts (ie take part in operating risk) will benefit most. In this regard, CDL Hospitality Trusts (SGX:J85) (62% SG NPI) and Far East Hospitality Trust (SGX:Q5T) (100% SG NPI) are expected to benefit more from the scheme compared to Ascott Residence Trust (SGX:HMN) (10% FY19 GP).",
      "\nProviding more pain relief.",
      "The Supplementary Budget 2020 was very much about assisting the sectors that have been, and will continue to be, hard hit by the COVID-19 outbreak: Aviation, F&B, and hospitality. With an eye on the economic damage and savings erosion that could take place if social distancing and stay-home measures persist, the budget provides generous support to lower-income households and individuals, taking into account the increased labour participation in the gig economy and the self-employed.",

      "Singapore Airlines is proposing an equity rights issue and convertible bond issue for a total of S$8.8bn, with an option to issue another S$6.2bn in convertible bonds.",
      "The capital raising is very significant against its 31 Dec 2019 equity base of S$12bn, and will ensure Singapore Airlines survives and thrives in the post-Covid-19 period.",
      "Maintain HOLD, but we cut core EPS forecasts and reduce our target price to S$6.27 (still based on 0.86x P/BV, 1 s.d. below mean since 2011).",
      "Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) proposed today to undertake a 3-for-2 rights issue of 1,777.7m new shares at an issue price of S$3 (53.8% below the closing share price and 31.8% below the theoretical ex-rights price of S$4.40) to raise S$5.3bn. It also proposed a rights issue of mandatory convertible bonds (MCB) of S$3.5bn on the basis of 295 MCBs for every 100 shares.",
      "In addition, Singapore Airlines will seek shareholder approval at a to-be-convened EGM to issue a further S$6.2bn in MCBs within 15 months from the EGM.",
      "Altogether, Singapore Airlines has the potential to raise up to S$15bn in new capital, comprising S$8.8bn this year (S$5.3bn in new rights shares and S$3.5bn in MCBs), plus S$6.2bn in additional MCBs over the next 15+ months.",
      "Temasek, as the 55.5% shareholder of Singapore Airlines, has given an undertaking to subscribe for its portion of the rights shares and MCBs, and also to subscribe for any undersubscribed portion, meaning that the success of the exercise is assured and Singapore Airlines will not need to arrange for investment bank underwriting.",
      "Separately, Singapore Airlines will also secure an S$4bn bridging loan from DBS to ensure liquidity.",
      "See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price; Singapore Airlines Analyst Reports; Singapore Airlines Dividend History; Singapore Airlines Announcements; Singapore Airlines Latest News.",
      "This capital raising is very significant against its 31 Dec 2019 equity base of S$12bn, and its current base of 1,185m ordinary shares will increase 2.5x to 2,963m shares.",
      "The MCBs are only convertible at their 10th year maturity; hence dilution is a distant concern. The zero-coupon MCBs are redeemable at the option of Singapore Airlines, and the implied yields depend on the timing of the redemption; redemption up to end of the 4th anniversary will carry a yield of 4% p.a., increasing to 5% yield in Years 5-7 and 5% in Years 8-10.",
      "We view the capital raising as essential to handle the Covid-19 crisis and will ensure not just Singapore Airlines\u2019s survival, but also increase its future probability of thriving against its competitors.",
      "While the MCBs will be treated as equity on Singapore Airlines\u2019s balance sheet, our view is that Singapore Airlines will probably want to redeem the MCBs if possible. Hence, for the purposes of deriving our target price for Singapore Airlines, we have treated the MCBs as debt, and not as equity.",
      "Under this assumption, we forecast the post-rights BVPS of Singapore Airlines to be S$4.94, which we gross up by a factor of 0.68 to derive the cum-rights BVPS of S$7.30. Against this, we apply our multiple of 0.86x to derive our cum-rights target price of S$6.27.",

      "The rights issue of S$8.8bn proceeds (new shares of S$5.3bn and MCBs of S$3.5bn) is expected to be completed in 3-4 months, following which the DBS bridging loan of S$4bn will be repaid.",
      "A potential issue of an additional S$6.2bn in MCBs depends on the trajectory of Covid-19, and it will be issued only if absolutely necessary.",
      "About 40% of Singapore Airlines\u2019s operating costs are fixed in nature (i.e. around S$4bn p.a., or less given cost savings initiatives), counting in fuel hedging losses which cannot be avoided. Only 20% of its total group staff costs of S$3bn p.a. are variable as these comprise crew flying allowances.",
      "Singapore Airlines will set aside S$3.7bn from the S$8.8bn rights proceeds to cover about one year\u2019s worth of fixed operating costs.",
      "Separately, Singapore Airlines will set aside S$1.8bn from the rights proceeds to cover debt and lease liabilities payments and interest expenses. This should cover Singapore Airlines's S$1.5m annual cash outflows in this regard.",
      "Finally, Singapore Airlines will set aside S$3.3bn from the rights proceeds to cover capex.",
      "Singapore Airlines\u2019s previous guidance of capex commitment was S$6bn for FY21F, with the difference to be financed separately via secured borrowings. Singapore Airlines is unable to negotiate delivery deferrals at short notice as the agreements with aircraft manufacturers do not give Singapore Airlines such flexibility.",
      "See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price; Singapore Airlines Analyst Reports; Singapore Airlines Dividend History; Singapore Airlines Announcements; Singapore Airlines Latest News.",
      "Singapore Airlines is proceeding with a rights issue as this can effectively raise a lot of cash quickly.",
      "Although Singapore Airlines has S$13bn-14bn in unencumbered aircraft, it cannot sell and leaseback (S&LB) more than S$4bn in aircraft value due to certain negative covenants. And currently, appetite among lessors for new S&LB deals is poor, so Singapore Airlines estimates it can only raise S$1bn at the very most through S&LB. Hence, a rights issue is the best way forward, and also important to put Singapore Airlines in a strong position to be able to immediately redeploy its aircraft once the Covid-19 pandemic passes.",

      "\nSingapore Strategy - Measures To Cushion Impact, Not Turnaround",
      "The second relief package of S$48bn was a positive surprise but we caution that this is to cushion the impact, not to engineer a turnaround.",
      "The biggest relief is the enhanced job support scheme helping the aviation, tourism-related and food services industries; Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L), SATS (SGX:S58), Genting Singapore (SGX:G13) and Jumbo Group (SGX:42R).",
      "Our economist cut 2020 GDP growth to -2.6% assuming normalisation of the economy by end-Jul. We keep 13% y-o-y decline in market EPS for 2020F.",
      "\nWorst economic contraction since independence",
      "According to flash estimates released by the Singapore government, the economy contracted by 2.2% y-o-y in 1Q20, reversing the 1% growth in the preceding quarter. On a q-o-q seasonally adjusted annualised basis, the economy shrank by 10.6%, a sharp pullback from the 0.6% growth in the previous quarter. This is the worst contraction since independence and the Global Financial Crisis in 2009, and compares with the +1% logged in 1Q19.",
      "Taking into account the weaker-than-expected performance of the Singapore economy in 1Q20, and the sharp deterioration in the external and domestic economic environment since Feb, the Singapore government further downgraded the GDP growth forecast for 2020 to \u201c-4.0 to -1.0%\u201d. The wider forecast range is to account for heightened uncertainties in the global economy, given the unprecedented nature of the Covid-19 outbreak, including the public health measures taken in many countries to contain the outbreak.",
      "Our economist cut 2020 GDP growth to -2.6% assuming normalisation of the economy by end-Jul. We keep our forecast of a 13% y-o-y decline in market EPS for 2020F.",
      "\nSave jobs, support workers and protect livelihoods",
      "We believe the second relief package is designed to help the population to keep and create jobs in the midst of crisis. During SARS and the Global Financial Crisis, unemployment for Singapore residents peaked at 6.2% and 4.9%, respectively.",
      "\nS$15.1bn for 1.9 million employees, more than twice during the GFC.",
      "We think this is the biggest relief from the supplementary budget. In general, the government\u2019s co-fund wages will increase from 8% to 25% for each local worker.",
      "Firms in the food services sector will receive higher support, at 50% of wages. Firms in the aviation and tourism sectors, which are the most badly affected sectors, will be supported at 75% of wages.",
      "The government will also raise the qualifying wage ceiling to S$4,600, up from S$3,600. The scheme will be extended for another two quarters until the end of 2020.",
      "Figure3 in attached PDF report lists the impact from all the sectors under our coverage with Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L), SATS (SGX:S58), Genting Singapore (SGX:G13) and Jumbo Group (SGX:42R) being the biggest beneficiaries.",
      "The government is increasing the value of its assistance to the aviation sector significantly. In the original February budget, the government promised S$112m in assistance to the aviation industry, of which a small estimated S$16m is due to be received by Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L). In this March supplementary budget, an additional S$350m \u2018enhanced aviation support package\u2019 has been set aside to fund measures such as rebates on landing and parking charges, and rental relief for airlines, ground handlers and cargo agents.",
      "We estimate that Singapore Airlines may receive some S$50m from this enhanced package (no details provided), which means that SIA may benefit from c.S$46m in total assistance, which is not material relative to its annualised cash operating costs of S$13bn. The larger impact comes from the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS). We estimate that the SIA group has c.25,000 staff in total, comprising 16,000 staff at SIA mainline, 4,500 at SilkAir and Scoot (our estimate), and 4,500 staff at SIA Engineering (SGX:S59).",
      "Assuming 80% of the group staff are Singapore citizens or permanent residents, the cost savings are a maximum of S$621m (25,000 staff x 80% x S$4,600/month x 9 months x 75%). With total SIA group staff costs at approximately S$3bn p.a. normally, staff cost savings would be around 21%, which is quite significant. Against SIA group\u2019s annualised cash operating costs of S$13bn, the JSS would amount to some 5% cost savings.",
      "See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price; Singapore Airlines Analyst Reports; Singapore Airlines Dividend History; Singapore Airlines Announcements; Singapore Airlines Latest News.",
      "We estimate a total receipt of c.S$51m/quarter (or S$153m for 9 months) assuming 5,000 or 50% of its Singapore-based staff (excluding Singapore Food Industries) qualify for JSS. Similar to SIA, SATS (SGX:S58) will benefit from the S$350m enhanced aviation support package such as licence fee/rental relief. The 100% property tax rebate for cruise terminals also help but we believe the overall impact is minimal.",
      "The pressure from revenue plunge from the global lockdown exceeds the cost savings and could lead to a cash burn of c.S$120m-150m in FY3/21F, wiping out its historical net gearing position. Our current Target Price of S$4.07 (19x CY21F P/E) has not incorporated potential losses and cash burn effects.",
      "See SATS Share Price; SATS Target Price; SATS Analyst Reports; SATS Dividend History; SATS Announcements; SATS Latest News.",
      "The enhanced property tax rebate could represent FY20F cost savings of c.S$20m (c.2% of FY20F admin costs). We estimate the JSS could result in cost savings of S$50m-150m (c.4- 12.3% of FY20F admin costs) assuming 60% of Genting Singapore (SGX:G13)'s workers are eligible locals, FY20F staff costs are c.S$450m and applying the wage grant brackets of 25%-75%. Should both these measures kick in, FY20F EBITDA could be lifted by c.10%-26% and FY20F net profit by c.22-54%.",
      "We await further reconfirmation of such cost savings from management but are positive that the measures could cushion the impact from the significant reduction in tourist flows.",
      "See Genting Singapore Share Price; Genting Singapore Target Price; Genting Singapore Analyst Reports; Genting Singapore Dividend History; Genting Singapore Announcements; Genting Singapore Latest News.",
      "Staff cost make up 55% of Jumbo Group (SGX:42R)'s FY19 opex. Assuming local hires make up 60% of its total workforce, the scheme could potentially result in additional cost savings of up to c.S$7.5m for Jumbo Group or 16% of staff costs. The key concern lies in lower footfall in stores. Rental accounted for 17% of Jumbo Group's FY19 opex and the eventual impact will depend on negotiations with landlords to see how much of the cost savings can be passed on.",
      "See Jumbo Group Share Price; Jumbo Group Target Price; Jumbo Group Analyst Reports; Jumbo Group Dividend History; Jumbo Group Announcements; Jumbo Group Latest News.",
      "The increased property tax rebate to 100% (from 30%) for qualifying commercial properties such as hotels, serviced apartments, tourist attractions, shops and restaurants are likely to be passed on to tenants to defray some of the tenants' operating costs. The measure is not expected to boost landlord revenue. Together with the JSS, hotel operators will see a positive impact as staff cost is the major component of their operating expenses.",
      "From the hotel REITs perspective, the wage credit is likely to have a positive impact at the property level but minimal on the REITs given their master lease structure. The property tax rebate could cushion the hospitality REITs FY20 DPU decline if they do not pass on the rebate. All other non-residential properties such as office and industrial property will receive a new property tax rebate of 30% but we think tax savings are likely to be passed on to tenants.",
      "Since our last strategy report Singapore Strategy - CGS-CIMB Research 2020-03-12: Going Into Deeper Value Zone, the market has whipsawed by 8-16%. We are not optimistic yet but there are names that have broken the GFC lows, including Sembcorp Industries (SGX:U96), Sembcorp Marine (SGX:S51), Keppel Corp (SGX:BN4) and Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (SGX:BS6). See Figure7 in attached PDF report for complete list. There are also those that are well above the low with an average of 30% downside, and possibly trading short ideas.",
      "We keep our estimate of a 13% y-o-y decline in market EPS for 2020F but further cut our CY20F FSSTI target to 2,050 (from 2,595), now based on 9.5x CY21F (from 12.2x CY21F P/E) and pegged to the average market P/E during GFC (Oct 08 to Mar 09) as the likely level.",

We estimate this could help cushion any potential decline in ST Engineering\u2019s performance in FY20 to a significant extent.

At the same, this should help to stem the risk of potential tenant closures (and unwarranted vacancies spiking in the near term). The increase in property tax rebate from 30% to 100% for the most directly impacted sectors (retail, hospitality and MICE) will be timely for landlords.",
      "With calls from government to pass down the rebates to the tenants, we believe most landlords will do so and provide more (on top of marketing efforts for retailers) in the immediate term. The hoteliers will also be able to mitigate near term losses as island-wide occupancies drop towards the low 30%-35% with Singapore limiting entry to tourists (passenger traffic at the airport since the lockdown has fallen more than 90%).",

We view the global spread of Covid-19 with alarm as the sharp fall in demand for SIA\u2019s regional flights will now spread to its long-haul flights and, in the process, hurt the take-up rate of lucrative business and first class cabins.",
      "The impact on SIA group\u2019s earnings is hard to estimate accurately, as it will depend on the duration and magnitude of the pandemic, and how long it will take to be controlled. The assessment of one expert in Singapore that \u2018the virus is here to stay until end-2020\u2019 is bad news for SIA. It would appear, in our view, that the \u2018all-clear\u2019 sign is still months away, hence investors may remain cautious even at the current low share price levels.",
      "Our forecasts assume that the SIA group will continue to see lower y-o-y capacity, demand, load factor and yields in FY21F, and we think that core net profits will be suppressed at the S$200m-250m level for both FY20F and FY21F, before a sharp rise to above S$600m in FY22F, assuming that there are no further shocks.",
      "We estimate a S$1.9bn balance sheet hit in 4QFY20F from mark-to-market (MTM) losses on SIA\u2019s outstanding fuel hedges, which have been contracted for the next five years.",
      "The MTM losses are calculated using the Brent crude forward price curve as at 12pm GMT+8 (spot price of US$34/bbl, per-barrel average forward price for FY21-25F of US$40, US$45, US$50, US$51, and US$53, respectively). The estimated MTM loss will reduce our end-Mar 2020F BVPS to S$8.71 (from S$11.23 as at 31 Mar 2019). Our end-Mar 2021F BVPS rises to S$9.33, on the assumption of a US$5/bbl rise in the forward curve, against which we apply a P/BV of 0.86x (1 s.d. below the average since 2011), to derive our target price of S$8.",
      "As at 2pm today, SIA's share price of S$7.38 is trading at 0.72x its end-Dec 2019 historical BVPS of S$10.26, below the long-term P/BV trough of (2 s.d. below the average).",

      "\nSingapore Strategy - Going Into Deeper Value Zone",
      "For stock markets to rally convincingly, the crucial ingredient is confidence, now lacking amid oil price crash, rate cuts and global pandemic.",
      "We cut our end-2020 FSSTI target to 2,595 (12.2x CY21F P/E; -2 s.d of 10- year mean) on -13% decline in FY20F EPS. FY21F EPS growth of 4% at risk.",
      "Any rebound in market should be used as a selling opportunity, waiting for lower entry. In this report, we screened for names near our conviction buys.",
      "With a variety of triggers capable of triggering a contagion, the situation now is akin to a perfect storm brewing. Unexpected interest rate cuts by central banks, with possibility of more cuts ahead, imply slower growth. Stimulus measures by many countries to cope with Covid-19 imply potential worsening ahead, and oil price crash intensifies the fear of demand destruction. WHO\u2019s declaration of a global pandemic could change major political and economic ramifications.",
      "We see vulnerability in banks (NIM cuts, slowdown in loans), developers (potentially slower take-up rates), and some expensive REITs e.g. Keppel DC REIT (SGX:AJBU) (2.07x P/BV, 4% yield).",
      "We lower our end-2020F FSSTI to 2,595, still based on -2 s.d. of 10-year mean, as we expect FSSTI EPS to decline 13% in 2020F, factoring in a more severe compression in bank earnings on heightened default risks compounded by the oil price crash. Dearth of oil & gas orders in 2020F is almost inevitable, on top of equipment supply chain disruptions due to Covid-19.",
      "Our forecast of a c.4% earnings recovery for FSSTI in 2021F incorporated slight pessimism in revenue growth, but we see room for weak operating leverage if a recession sets in (typically when corporate earnings contract for two years).",
      "We identify 2,400 as the FSSTI level that reflects recession (2-year average earnings decline of c.20%), and 2,050 as the likely level in the event of a crisis (total 2-year decline of 30%).",
      "Our technical analyst now expects further downside to the 2,520 support level. Any rebound near term would likely be temporary, in our view.",
      "Focusing on the more liquid stocks, we identify target individual entry levels for stocks, based \u201cclose to trough\u201d levels. On average, share prices need to fall another 18% before we are convicted to buy.",
      "We list our target entry levels of key stocks in Figs 3-5 in attached PDF report. Some safer names that are close to buy levels are SingTel (SGX:Z74), Wilmar (SGX:F34) and ST Engineering (SGX:S63).",
      "The capital goods sector presents the deepest value, with names that could double the money in 3-5 years\u2019 time (but not for the faint hearted). Sembcorp (SGX:U96) (0.4x FY20F P/BV) is only worth 0.8x its utilities' net assets, and everything else is free. Sembcorp Marine (SGX:S51) (0.9x FY20F P/BV), and Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (SGX:BS6) (0.5x FY20F P/BV) have sunk to valuations lower than during the GFC and the oil crisis in 2016 -- due to the oil price crash and anticipation of slower shipbuilding if the global economy softens.",
      "Central banks around the world have eased monetary policies, not only in response to the current material deterioration in economic activity, but also to the risk of material deterioration in their respective economies. At the same time, many governments are rolling out or have rolled out Covid-19 relief packages to cushion their economies from the impact of its outbreak. However, monetary and fiscal policies cannot overcome a global healthcare crisis.",
      "Much will also depend on how soon the global fear factor can be contained. Therefore, the general market sentiment would likely remain depressed as the market accesses the threat of contagion risk.",
      "Last week, International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Kristalina Georgieva said global growth in 2020 will dip below last year's levels of 2.9%, but \u201chow far it will fall and how long the impact will be is still difficult to predict\".",
      "The US Federal Reserve has also signalled its concern over the impact Covid- 19 will have on the US economy when it on 3 Mar unexpectedly slashed its benchmark interest rate by 50bp to 1.25%. Historically, an emergency rate cut of 50bp or more only happened during crisis periods such as at the height of the Dot-Com bubble in Jan 2001 and the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in Sep 2007, kickstarting a bear market. Another 50bp rate cut in its scheduled 18 Mar Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting would mean one full percentage point rate cut in a month, signalling some crack signs in the US economy.",
      "If the US stock market remains in a risk-off mode even with the monetary support, the ongoing negative sentiment would worsen, leading to a further selloff globally including the FSSTI. Further interest rate cuts to 0.25% by Jun remains a highly probable scenario, according to the Fed Fund Futures. With the zero interest rate policy a possibility, the equity markets would likely remain depressed as the zero interest rate environment suggests a period of weak economic growth.",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of a global pandemic could be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.",
      "With WHO declaring a pandemic after being reluctant for weeks could hasten our much feared \u2018worst case\u2019 scenario. We fear that as the virus rapidly spreads across the world, US and the rest of Europe could see a sharp rise in infection cases and enters into a similar phase as Italy with the risk of sudden widespread outbreak leading to a partial lockdown of countries. This could push the world economy into a full-blown recession, the dreaded \"L\" growth.",
      "After the past few days' sell-down, the FSSTI now trades at c.12.9x CY21F P/E or 1 s.d. below 10-year mean. Still, we think it has room to de-rate as earnings forecasts can be fragile with our base case play, compounded by the oil price crash and impending rate cuts.",
      "Our stress tests on banks and capital goods companies, on lower NIM and weaker orders, respectively, on the back of depressed oil prices point to a 13% decline in market EPS for 2020F, with a hope of a 3.8% recovery in 2021F, assuming default risks dissipate. With that, our new FSSTI target is lowered to 2,595, still based on 12.2x CY21F P/E, -2 s.d. of 10-year mean.",
      "Given the low single-digit earnings growth expectation for 2021F, this puts FSSTI on the verge of a recession if earnings continue to dip, which could bring FSSTI to 2,400 (total earnings decline of 20% in 2 years). Crisis level would see sharper 2-year earnings contraction of 30% or more, sending the FSSTI to 2,100.",
      "We would look for opportunities to buy, closer to 2,400 points as this level is also cross-checked with most of the analysts' \"comfortable\u201d target entry prices. We go through most of the indexed stocks and small cap alpha picks to explore when would be a good time to buy, and at what price. In our screening process, we also identify the reasons why a stock should or not be valued at GFC levels, with arguments from liquidity and business resilience perspectives.",
      "On average, stocks still have 30% downside from current values to the \u201ccrisis\u201d level, and 18% to fundamental comfortable buy levels.",
      "We list down the top 9 stocks (above US$1bn market cap) that seem to be closer to our comfortable buy levels.\n\nSingTel (SGX:Z74) (target entry: below S$2.70): based on 1 s.d. below its 2006-2020 mean EV/OpFCF. It is currently offering attractive FY20-22F dividend yields of 5.9% p.a. This should provide share price support, as it is close to the 6.1% yield when Singtel's share price hit the trough in Oct 2008 during the GFC. See SingTel Share Price; SingTel Target Price.\nWilmar (SGX:F34) (target entry: below S$3.68): represents 20% below our SOP Target Price of S$4.58 (pricing in listing of its Chinese businesses at 18-22x forward P/E). We do not think it should be pegged to GFC valuations (5.36x P/E) given the current catalyst of listing its China assets. In addition, its integrated business model has allowed the group to produce consistent average core net profit of US$1.2bn over the past 10 years. See Wilmar Share Price; Wilmar Target Price.\nSingapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) (target entry: below S$7.50): based 0.75x historical P/BV pegging to GFC low. Factoring in massive marked to market losses based on forward Brent price curve on 10 March, our BVPS would reduce to S$8.71. See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price.\nYangzijiang Shipbuilding (SGX:BS6) (target entry: below S$0.85). It is trading at 0.48x CY20F P/BV, below GFC (2x P/BV) and 2016 oil crisis (0.6x P/BV), pricing in risks of contract cancellations and slowing order momentum, in our view. Risk to our earnings forecasts is low as we have recently tempered our order expectations to US$1.2bn vs. management's target of US$2bn. YTD order win is about US$320m. Orders dropped to a low of US$450m in 2009. See Yangzijiang Share Price; Yangzijiang Target Price.\nST Engineering (SGX:S63) (target entry: below S$3.84) based on 16.7x FY21F P/E (pegged to trough valuation during oil crisis in 2016). See ST Engineering Share Price; ST Engineering Target Price. Our stress test still points to a 5% y-o-y earnings growth in FY20F, assuming :-\n\nrevenue decline for aerospace (aircraft maintenance in FY20F on weaker aviation trend)\nrevenue decline for electronics (large-scale projects affected by reduced government spending)\n50% y-o-y decline in commercial ship repair volume on lower oil prices.\n\n\nKeppel Corp (SGX:BN4) (target entry: below S$5.15) based on 0.8x CY20F P/BV (pegged to trough during the oil crisis in 2016). The near-term catalyst is the partial offer from Temasek at S$7.35 per share. At current share price of S$5.55 and assuming the partial offer will be effective by 21 Oct 2020 (long-stop date), investor\u2019s purchase price would be S$4.40/share, or a discount of 20% to market value. The caveat for the partial offer to de-rail is if Keppel group\u2019s financial performance and condition deteriorate meaningfully over the period of Oct 2019 to the long-stop date. We do not expect major provisions or sharp plunge in earnings during this period, although the outlook for FY21F-FY22F could be dented by slow offshore & marine orders, and completion of property projects in China. See Keppel Corp Share Price; Keppel Corp Target Price.\nSembcorp (SGX:U96) (target entry: below S$1.64). Current valuations implies SMM is trading at distressed valuations of 0.5x CY20F P/BV and 0.3x CY20F P/BV for its utilities business, ascribing very low confidence on its 9% ROE and S$300m FY20F earnings. We did not pick SMM although it is trading at a new trough of 0.89x CY20F P/BV, a valuation ripe for M&A, as risks prevail with losses likely to persist into its fourth consecutive year in FY21F on lower oil prices and order momentum. See Sembcorp Share Price; Sembcorp Target Price.\nSheng Siong (SGX:OV8) (target entry: below S$1.18): based on long-term average of 20x forward P/E. Earnings growth of 12% in FY20F looks firm on higher store count. See Sheng Siong Share Price; Sheng Siong Target Price.\nSingPost (SGX:S08) (target entry: below S$0.71): based on -1 s.d. of long-term mean of 13.7x FY21F P/E. We believe it should not be pegged to its GFC low of 10x P/E as it is a proxy for regional ecommerce growth, making its logistics assets more valuable. Its net cash should sustain yield at 5% in FY21F. See SingPost Share Price; SingPost Target Price.\n\n",

      "\nSingapore Airlines (SIA) - Responding At Multiple Levels To Covid-19",
      "Singapore Airlines said at today\u2019s special briefing on Covid-19 that forward bookings continue to fall, with no bottom in sight yet, as the virus spreads globally.",
      "We reiterate our HOLD call, with an unchanged target price of S$8.46, based on 0.86x CY20F P/BV (1 s.d. below mean since 2011).",
      "Singapore Airlines (SIA, SGX:C6L) said that at the very peak during SARS, there was a 45-50% drop in demand. Right now, the Singapore Airlines group has not yet seen this quantum of decline yet, but the drop in passenger volumes has still been substantial, concentrated on leisure and discretionary travel, and slightly less for business-related travel. The response has been to cut capacity. Even so, passenger loads and yields are still lower y-o-y, forward bookings continue to fall, and have not yet seen bottom, in SIA\u2019s view.",
      "The SIA group\u2019s first wave of capacity cuts were related to Chinese routes in early Feb, with cuts implemented for Scoot, SIA and SilkAir. Scoot, in particular, cancelled all of its flights to China, although the full-service carriers (FSCs) still maintain their core flights to the key cities where there are large populations of Singaporeans.",
      "The second wave of network adjustments concentrated on NE Asia and SE Asia routes, with services maintained in all those cities at lower frequencies. The third wave of cuts was to the US, Europe, SW Pacific and SE Asia, as Covid-19 spread globally.",
      "The Mar 2020 ASK capacity for SIA and SilkAir combined has been reduced 12% y-o-y and 15-16% lower against the original planned schedule. For the Mar-May 2020 period, ASK is down 6.1% y-o-y and 10.3% lower than the original schedule. Scoot\u2019s ASK capacity has been cut 35-40% against its original plan (as China flights made up 25-26% of total capacity, plus with negative secondary impacts on SE Asian demand to travel to China and NE Asia).",
      "By route region, flights to NE Asia and SE Asia have been reduced by at least 20%, while capacity elsewhere has been cut in the low to high single-digits percentage over the Mar-May period. The Kangaroo route between Europe and SW Pacific was heavily cut for May as it is seasonally weak anyway.",
      "The decision to cut flights depends on which flights cover variable costs and depending on the volume of passengers and load factors. Variable cost breakeven load factor ranges between 40% at the low end, and 60-65% at the high end. The variable cost breakeven load factors vary depending on route yields, aircraft types, route distance, flight operating costs, etc. SIA is concerned about the flights that have variable cost breakeven load factors at the 60-65% level.",
      "SIA has to be mindful about its capacity cuts as the EU is not waiving airlines\u2019 obligation to fly at least 80% of its slots to keep their rights to use the same slots in the next Northern Winter or Northern Summer season. Thankfully, China has waived this obligation temporarily.",
      "SIA is working on securing more lines of credit to support near-term liquidity requirements of the business during the Covid-19 crisis. Currently, SIA has S$1.5bn- 2bn of available credit lines to draw on. SIA is not concerned about raising longer-duration funding for capex requirements. Banks have been supportive of SIA to date.",
      "SIA is discussing with suppliers on getting rate discounts and price concessions, although this remains work-in-progress. SIA is working with aircraft OEM suppliers to reschedule or defer aircraft pre-delivery payment schedules, as well as working to defer non-essential non-aircraft capex in consultation with suppliers.",
      "Staff costs will be reduced as the CEO and senior management staff have taken a pay cut, ranging from 5-15%. A voluntary no-pay leave scheme will be offered to staff, including cabin crew and pilots. The S$112m assistance package announced by the government of Singapore is spread over six months across a number of stakeholders, hence will not be material to the SIA group.",

      "\nSingapore 2020 Budget - Deploying Lifeboats",
      "The major focus is on helping the Singapore economy ride through the negative impact from the COVID-19 outbreak. We see some decent near-term impact from the Budget in selective sectors.",
      "Maintain 2020 year-end FSSTI target of 3,370 (c.5.4% upside), however, we note that there is downside risk should the COVID-19 issue stretch beyond mid-20.",
      "Singapore\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister (DPM), Mr Heng Swee Keat delivered the 2020 Budget yesterday. Key highlights from his speech include:\n\nRelief from COVID-19 outbreak. The government plans to spend S$6.4b on various initiatives to assist the economy as well as target key sectors affected by the outbreak, ie aviation, retail, tourism & hospitality. These include various tax rebates, allowance for faster write-downs of investments in plant & equipment and renovation and refurbishment, increase in size of government-backed working capital loans to SMEs and rental waivers.\nGoods & Services Tax (GST). The higher GST rate of 9% will not take effect in 2021 and thus the 7% rate will remain in 2021, however the DPM ,stated that the government cannot put off the increase indefinitely as the COVID-19 outbreak has underlined the importance for the government to have recurrent sources of revenue, especially for healthcare. He stated that the GST increase will need to happen by 2025 and the government will provide a S$6b assurance package to cushion the impact when the GST increase comes along.\nTransformation to continue. The DPM noted that Singapore needed to be cognisant of four structural shifts in the future: The decline in support for globalisation, the shift in global economic weight towards Asia, the rapid advancement of technology and the country\u2019s transition toward an ageing society. These four issues were addressed in the budget via S$8.4b in spending programmes to assist the country in its transformation.\nClimate change initiatives. Following on from the Prime Minister\u2019s National Day Rally speech in Aug 19, the budget outlined various medium to long-term measures to tackle this issue. Much of the measures were focused on electric vehicles (EVs) with the two key items being the phasing out of the use of internal combustion engine vehicles in Singapore by 2040, and expanding the public infrastructure for charging EVs from the current 1,600 charging points to 28,000 by 2030 implying a 33% CAGR. In addition, to prepare Singapore for rising sea levels, the budget allocated S$5b for a new coastal protection fund that the DPM stated would be topped up in the future.\nIn 2019, Singapore saw a budget deficit of S$1.65b (0.3% of GDP), less than the deficit of S$3.48b forecasted a year ago. In 2020, the budget will remain expansionary, with total expenditure projected to rise 7.0% y-o-y to S$83.61b and an overall budget deficit of S$10.95b or 2.1% of GDP.\n\n",
      "Relief from COVID-19 outbreak. The government plans to spend S$6.4b on various initiatives to assist the economy as well as target key sectors affected by the outbreak, ie aviation, retail, tourism & hospitality. These include various tax rebates, allowance for faster write-downs of investments in plant & equipment and renovation and refurbishment, increase in size of government-backed working capital loans to SMEs and rental waivers.",
      "Goods & Services Tax (GST). The higher GST rate of 9% will not take effect in 2021 and thus the 7% rate will remain in 2021, however the DPM ,stated that the government cannot put off the increase indefinitely as the COVID-19 outbreak has underlined the importance for the government to have recurrent sources of revenue, especially for healthcare. He stated that the GST increase will need to happen by 2025 and the government will provide a S$6b assurance package to cushion the impact when the GST increase comes along.",
      "Transformation to continue. The DPM noted that Singapore needed to be cognisant of four structural shifts in the future: The decline in support for globalisation, the shift in global economic weight towards Asia, the rapid advancement of technology and the country\u2019s transition toward an ageing society. These four issues were addressed in the budget via S$8.4b in spending programmes to assist the country in its transformation.",

In addition, airlines which operated flights from China to Singapore before COVID-19, will receive landing credits while those that operated flights on the sector post COVID-19 will receive 100% landing fee rebates",
      "Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) - Reduction in landing and parking charges along with rebates could amount to $20m- 25m in cost savings, while cost savings from Jobs Saving Support Scheme could amount to a similar quantum.",
      "SIA Engineering (SGX:S59) is likely to receive rental rebates for premises at Changi.",
      "SATS LTD. (SGX:S58) will benefit from the Jobs Support Scheme as wage cost accounts for 50% of opex. Budget 2020 did not specify a reduction in licensing fees, but allowed for a 10% rebate on rental fees. SATS will also benefit from a 15% reduction in property tax rebate on the Marina Bay Cruise Centre.",
      "ST Engineering (SGX:S63) - While the Jobs Support Scheme is likely to lead to savings on labour cost out of Singapore, ST Marine will likely be impacted by a reduction in the foreign worker sub-Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) in 2021, when the ratio would be reduced from 20% to 18% and subsequently to 15% by Jan 23.",
      "\nCONSTRUCTION (MARKET WEIGHT \u2013 unchanged)",
      "S Pass Sub-DRC will be reduced from 20% to 15% while foreign worker levy remains the same. We view that it to be largely neutral for the construction sector as work-permit holders constitute a larger proportion of foreign workers compared to S Pass holders.",

      "HDB to provide half month worth of rental waivers to commercial tenants. For service-related companies under our coverage, Koufu (SGX:VL6) and Sheng Siong (SGX:OV8) leases a significant number of HDB shop units. While we estimate roughly 50% of Koufu\u2019s outlets are located around HDB estates, we think the cost savings from the rental waiver will potentially be passed on to its stall tenants. For Sheng Siong, we estimate > 70% of its stores are HDB units, some of which are rented from private landlords. We estimate 1.5- 2.1% positive earnings impact, based on an assumption that 35-50% of total rent is paid to HDB. That said, we reckon most of the savings could be used to cushion the increase in input prices should there be supply chain distributions resulting from COVID-19, thus limiting the impact on earnings.",
      "JSS to help companies that are labour intensive with low wage hires. We believe that the scheme could help companies such as Koufu, Jumbo Group (SGX:42R) and Sheng Siong. Labour cost accounts for more than 10% of revenue for the former two while employee-benefit costs forms 30-31% of Jumbo Group\u2019s revenue.",
      "Based on the DRC for the services sector, we estimate local hires command 60-70% of its total workforce. The scheme is limited to local hires and is also subjected to a wage cap of S$3,600, which is approximately the average salary or lower for most of the labor-intensive jobs in the sector. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates cost savings of S$0.5-1.5m from the JSS scheme, as well the enhancement of the Wage Credit Scheme. This translates to a positive earnings impact of roughly 3.6% for Koufu and Jumbo Group, and 1.8% for Sheng Siong.",
      "\nGAMING (OVERWEIGHT \u2013 unchanged)",
      "Property tax rebate of 10%. Singapore\u2019s integrated resorts will be granted a 10% property tax rebate for 2020. We opine that this would be marginally positive to Resort World Sentosa\u2019s property tax with savings estimated at about S$1m-2m, or < 1% of net profit on our estimates.",
      "\nLAND TRANSPORT (MARKET WEIGHT \u2013 unchanged)",
      "Largely status quo for ComfortDelGro (SGX:C52) in near term, in our view. A rebate (up to 45% on the Additional Registration Fee (ARF), capped at $20,000) on purchases on fully electric taxis as well as a wide deployment of chargers is a more aggressive push for fully electric vehicles. Currently, electric vehicle taxis only make up a small proportion, about 0.7% of the total taxi population in 2019, mainly undertaken by HDT Taxi. A lower road tax for hybrid cars may be a positive, albeit on a marginal extent.",
      "\nREITs (OVERWEIGHT \u2013 unchanged)",
      "Retail REITs will benefit from property tax rebate of 15% for their retail and F&B spaces. Most retail REITs intend to pass the 15% property tax rebate to their tenants in the form of rent reduction. Many retail REITs are also working on other targeted measures to help their tenants tide through this difficult period. We do not expect any material impact on distributable income for retail REITs. Maintain BUY for CapitaLand Mall Trust (SGX:C38U) (Target: S$2.88) and Frasers Centrepoint Trust (SGX:J69U) (Target: S$3.05).",
      "Hospitality REITs will benefit from property tax rebate of 30%. The biggest beneficiary is Far East Hospitality Trust (SGX:Q5T), a pure play on Singapore\u2019s hospitality sector which could see its 2020F DPU increase by 4% from 2.73 S cents to 2.84 S cents. However, 2021F DPU is unchanged at 3.90 S cents. Maintain HOLD (Target: S$0.65).",
      "\nSHIPYARD & INDUSTRIALS (MARKET WEIGHT \u2013 unchanged)",
      "In order to regulate the inflow of foreign workers, the government has lowered the S-Pass sub-DRC for the construction, process and marine sectors in two phases: phase one will see the DRC decline from 20% to 18% in 2021, and phase two will see this 18% further decline to 15% in 2023.",
      "Keppel Corporation (SGX:BN4) (BUY/ Target: S$7.75) and Sembcorp Marine (SGX:S51) (HOLD/Fair Value: S$1.40) have notably continued their efforts to raise productivity and efficiency in the past few years to offset higher labour costs to mitigate the adverse impact of Singapore's long-term restrictions on foreign labour. In our view, the lower S Pass sub-DRC will have a limited negative impact on Keppel Corporation and Sembcorp Marine.",
      "Providing relief. Without neglecting the medium to longer term challenges that an open economy like Singapore will face, Budget 2020 was very much about providing relief to households as well as those sectors that have been buffeted by the COVID-19 outbreak: aviation, consumer staples, F&B, hospitality, and retail. Lower tourist arrivals as well as government and corporate measures to limit crowds (and thus the spread of the coronavirus) have collectively taken a bite out of consumer spending. We believe that the measures announced today are adequate but could be tweaked in the coming months should things worsen.",
      "Key stocks impacted by Budget 2020. In our coverage, companies such as Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L), SATS (SGX:S58) and SIA Engineering (SGX:S59) in the aviation sector and Koufu (SGX:VL6) and Sheng Siong Group (SGX:OV8) in the consumer staples sectors are key beneficiaries from Budget 2020. Companies that are marginally negatively affected by the lower S Pass sub-DRC ratios include Keppel Corporation (SGX:BN4), Sembcorp Marine (SGX:S51) and ST Engineering (SGX:S63).",
      "Weak GDP growth forecasted for 2020. We note that UOB Global Economics Markets Research (UOB GEMR) downgraded its NODX growth outlook to -1.0% y-o-y in 2020, down from a previous +1.5% outlook made in Dec 19. UOB GEMR highlighted downside risks to its newly-formed NODX outlook should the COVID-19 outbreak be more widespread, severe and protracted than expected. The downgrade is also expected to drag overall economic growth, where it now expects Singapore\u2019s GDP to grow by merely 0.5% y-o-y in 2020, down from its previous forecast range of between 0.5\u20131.0%."

      "Consumer sector could be the biggest winner with cash distribution and grocery vouchers implying a slight uptick in spending. No GST hike in 2021.",
      "We welcome the job support scheme to ease short-term staff costs, but the Covid-19 relief offers very little reprieve to affected industries, in our view.",
      "Stocks with direct implication: Sheng Siong Group (SGX:OV8), Dairy Farm International (SGX:D01), Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L), SATS (SGX:S58), CDL Hospitality Trusts (SGX:J85), Far East Hospitality Trust (SGX:Q5T), UOL Group (SGX:U14), Genting Singapore (SGX:G13), ComfortDelGro (SGX:C52), Jumbo Group (SGX:42R), Yongnam (SGX:AXB) and ST Engineering (SGX:S63).",
      "The budget is designed to help the population keep jobs and cushion against the negative impact of Covid-19 on corporates. Refer to our economist report for details. From the perspective of equity, the relief offers a mild positive impact to the affected sectors - gaming, hospitality, F&B, aviation, airport services, land transport, retail and SMEs (See Figure2 and Figure3 in attached PDF report for summary).",
      "We keep our FSSTI target for CY20 at 3,275 pts, based on 12.5x CY21F P/E.",
      "We think the consumer sector (mainly supermarket operators such as Sheng Siong Group (SGX:OV8) and Dairy Farm International (SGX:D01)\u2019s Giant outlets) gains the most, thanks to the implied one-off uptick in spending as a result of cash distribution and grocery vouchers. The labour-intensive structure could also benefit from a short-term jab of job support scheme grants for wages capped at S$3.6k. We expect Sheng Siong Group to generate c.12% EPS growth in FY20F. Upside could come from stronger sales and rebates.",
      "The impact from property tax rebates across sectors to cope with potentially lower revenue is generally minimal. The highest rebate (30%) goes to the hospitality sector but the impact of the rebates is likely to be marginal to earnings.",
      "We estimate savings of 1- 2% and 1-3% of NPI and distributable income, respectively, for hospitality REITs. Companies under our coverage with exposure to the hospitality sector include CDL Hospitality Trusts (SGX:J85), Far East Hospitality Trust (SGX:Q5T), OUE Commercial REIT (SGX:TS0U) and Suntec REIT (SGX:T82U) (convention business). For Singapore hotel owners such as UOL Group (SGX:U14), tax savings are minimal at c.1% of net profit.",
      "We think this change will have a neutral to slightly positive impact on share prices of REITs and developers. For hospitality trusts, the operating environment remains challenging with an expected slowdown in tourist arrivals and drag on occupancy and room rates. Trading conditions are likely to remain difficult for retailers, especially those in the discretionary shopping category.",
      "Singapore Airlines (SGX:C6L) will likely benefit from rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges as these direct costs account for 7% of the group\u2019s opex, but the quantum of the rebates is quite small. We estimate that SIA Group will save at least S$16m-17m in costs over a six-month period, not material against its half-year cash operating costs of c.S$6.5bn.",
      "We estimate SATS (SGX:S58) to have one-off savings of c.S$3m on staff costs in the upcoming quarter from the job support scheme. The higher ceiling for the wage credit scheme could also add S$2m- 3m p.a. The total impact is also minimal given that SATS\u2019 staff costs amount to c.S$230m/quarter (or c.47% of average opex).",
      "The upside is if there is any incentive from Changi Airport to reduce SATS\u2019 licence fees (as it did during 2016-17 due to the soft aviation industry then). SATS incurs licence fees of c.S$23m/quarter, or c.5% of average opex.",
      "We are slightly disappointed by the unchanged workers levy as well as the reduction of S Pass DRC for construction and marine sectors. These measures do not help companies such as Keppel Offshore & Marine, Sembcorp Marine (SGX:S51) Marine and Yongnam (SGX:AXB) that have a relatively high reliance on foreign workers.",
      "Conversely, the smart-nation focus continues as the government will be dishing out S$1bn spending over three years on cyber security and data protection capabilities. ST Engineering (SGX:S63)\u2019s electronic division could see a mild positive from this.",

As such, 3QFY20 net profit grew 10.9% y-o-y to S$315m, as associates and joint ventures\u2019 showed improvement in results and operating performance registered stronger growth.",

In addition, Scoot registered an operating profit of S$4m (+S$3m y-o-y, profit turned from a loss of S$36m in 2QFY19 to profit in 3QFY20), boosted by stronger passenger traffic (+6.8%).",
      "In light of COVID-19, the SIA parent airline and SilkAir have reduced frequencies to Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau routes while Scoot has suspended all routes to Mainland China until 28 Mar 2020. We understand that flights to Mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau represent ~14% of SIA\u2019s passenger capacity; given that these destinations represent a higher percentage of Scoot\u2019s capacity than the average across the group, we believe it would be hit harder in the near-term than the SIA parent and SilkAir.",
      "Management shared that they will be monitoring the situation closely and manage costs tightly e.g to revisit prepayment schedule for future aircrafts deliveries and to reduce some project expenditures. There is currently no plan to cut staff costs or ask staff to take unpaid leave to mitigate cost pressures amid weak demand.",
      "In 1QFY03 which was the worst period of SARS\u2019, SIA\u2019s revenue dropped 35% and suffered a net loss of S$312m. Remarkably, SIA\u2019s performance recovered fairly quickly once SARS was under control in the next quarter. In 2QFY03, SIA returned to profit.",
      "With the outbreak of COVID-19, we expect weaker travel demand which will in turn weigh on SIA\u2019s operating performance in 4QFY20/FY21. However, we believe that these setbacks are temporary and expect compensation/supportive policies from the government.",

It described the Covid-19 as having the greatest impact on demand for its China, HK and Macau flights, followed by flights to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan; demand for some connecting flights that land at the Singapore hub before proceeding to North Asia have been affected as well.",
      "Within ASEAN, demand to Thailand and Vietnam has been the most seriously affected. Yields have been hurt (SIA mainline\u2019s yields fell 6.7% y-o-y during the SARS epidemic in 2QCY03). Flights to China account for 11% of group ASK capacity (6% of SIA mainline\u2019s ASK capacity, 18% of SilkAir, 26% of Scoot) while flights to North Asia ex-China make up 16% of group ASK (18% of SIA mainline, 3% of SilkAir, and 14% of Scoot). SIA said that corporate and business class travel and long-haul travel have been less affected than discretionary leisure travel and short-haul travel. Hence, the LCC Scoot has taken a greater beating than the FSCs. Outbound cargo traffic from China and HK has also been hit hard, hurting SIA Cargo.",

      "The Singapore Airlines group performed very well, with 3Q core net profit up 33% y-o-y, a strong reversal from the 1H\u2019s 35% y-o-y fall in core net profit.",
      "As a recap, the poor 1H performance was on account of the weaker cargo performance (due to the US-China trade war), higher losses at Scoot due to heightened competition with Chinese carriers which impacted RASK and engine problems faced by its 787-9 fleet, higher losses at SilkAir due to the grounding of its 737 MAX 8 fleet, higher non-fuel unit costs (greater staff costs due to more headcount, higher pay rates and higher bonus provisions, larger commission payments), and higher share of associate losses (Virgin Australia and Vistara), all of which more than offset stronger operating performance at SIA mainline (higher loads and RASK due to successful revenue management) and better SIA Engineering (SGX:S59)\u00a0profits.",
      "In the 3Q, the challenging dynamics of the 1H seemed to be a distant memory.",
      "While the cargo performance was still weaker y-o-y, SilkAir\u2019s EBIT matched that of the previous year, Scoot delivered a small absolute improvement and the share of associate profits was actually higher y-o-y. However, the biggest star of the show was SIA mainline itself, delivering a staggering S$445m in EBIT (+21% y-o-y), its highest EBIT since Oct-Dec 2007, on the back of almost three consecutive years of RASK growth and a surprising 1.9% y-o-y fall in non-fuel unit cost (against 1H\u2019s 0.9% y-o-y increase).",
      "SIA\u00a0attributed the latter to \u201cinitiatives arising from the transformation programme\u201d and we will seek clarity at this morning\u2019s analyst briefing to see if this non-fuel CASK drop is sustainable or not. With fuel costs making up 33% of SIA group\u2019s airline operating costs, the 6% y-o-y drop in average post-hedge jet fuel price in the 3Q also made a big impact on the group\u2019s performance; in contrast, the 1H post-hedge jet fuel price averaged 1% higher y-o-y.",

      "Our FY20F core net profit forecast for SIA group suggests a S$280m loss for 4QFY20F. By comparison, SIA reported a S$305m core net loss for Apr-Jun 2003 when the SARS epidemic was at its peak.",

See Singapore Airlines Target Price.",
      "The first case of the coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province in Dec 2019, and this has spread rapidly since, particularly within China. In response to transmission fears, China banned group tours to foreign countries from 27 Jan, and Singapore banned anyone who has been to China in the past 14 days from entering the country effective 1 Feb, even on transit flights. Consequently, travel demand to China has collapsed, which hurts not just SIA group\u2019s direct flights to China, but also travel from other parts of the world to China via the Singapore hub.",
      "Anecdotally, we hear that even intra-ASEAN flight demand has been negatively affected. In short, we believe that SIA group will experience a large drop in travel demand, centered on its routes to China (plus HK and Macau), but also extending to many other parts of its route network.",
      "SIA mainline has cut ASK capacity to China by 47% for the month of Feb, and even if we assume the Feb cuts will be extended for three months, it will only amount to 3% of SIA mainline\u2019s quarterly ASK. In contrast, SIA mainline cut its ASK by 30% during the Apr-Jun 2003 quarter due to SARS.",

      "We think that SIA mainline and SilkAir need to be more aggressive in their China cuts in extent and duration, and all three airlines need to consider cutting other flights in their wider non-China network, without which, its load factors may fall below the low of 57% seen during the Apr-Jun 2003 SARS quarter, and the negative earnings impact could be greater.",
      "Our model assumes that the flight cancellations will impact the group for two whole quarters.",

While SIA booked in a single quarter\u2019s net loss of S$312m in the Apr-Jun 2003 quarter during SARS, we pencil in two quarters\u2019 losses in the Jan-Jun 2020F period totalling S$380m.",

      "We believe that the worries over a disease outbreak could weigh on travel demand as travelers would delay their travel plans, which could negatively affect airlines and related stocks. SIA\u00a0and SATS\u2019 share prices fell 1.9% and 3.6% respectively this week.",
      "If the coronavirus situation escalates further into a SARS-like situation, we believe that both companies\u2019 operating performances are likely to come under pressure, weighing on profits. However, we are more positive on SIA\u00a0over the longer-term given its growth outlook and relatively quick recovery during the SARS period. On the other hand, we remain cautious on SATS given its weak cargo volumes and soft operating margin.",
      "Recall that during the SARS outbreak from Nov 2002 to Aug 2003, visitor arrivals to Singapore fell 19.0% y-o-y from 7.6m in 2002 to 6.1m in 2003. The figure, however, quickly recovered and recorded a strong rebound of 36.0% y-o-y growth to 8.3m in 2004.",
      "During this period, SIA\u2019s share price dropped 22.4% i.e. 5 months to the trough level in end of April and took another 1.5 months to recover back to pre-SARS level. In 1QFY03 which was SARS\u2019 worst period, SIA reported a steep fall of 45.7% y-o-y in passenger carriage and 18.1 ppt decline in passenger load factor to 57.4%. SIA\u2019s revenue dropped 35% and suffered a net loss of S$312m. Consequently, SIA cut its capacity by over 30%. Remarkably, SIA\u2019s performance recovered fairly quickly once SARS was under control in the next quarter. In 2QFY03, SINGAPORE AIRLINES returned to profit. Net profit was 3.6% higher y-o-y. Passenger carriage also improved 80% q-o-q/-9% y-o-y while passenger load factor rebounded to 79.4, which was 1.3 ppt higher than the same period last year.",
      "As for SATS, 2002-2003 was also seen as a challenging period, which was severely affected by SARS and the weak macroeconomic environment. During this period, the share price dropped 15% i.e. 5 months to the trough level in mid-April and took another 1 month to recover back to its pre-SARS level. In FY03, SATS reported a dramatic drop in passengers handled (-15.9% y-o-y), meals catered (-11.1% y-o-y) and passengers served (-13.2% y-o-y). FY03 PATMI fell 11.6% and revenue declined 9.3%, partially aided by the strong recovery in traffic volume in the 2HFY03 (i.e Oct 2003-Mar 2004).",
      "Hospitality REITS under our coverage experienced a decline in share prices this week e.g. -5.2% for FAR EAST HOSPITALITY TRUST (SGX:Q5T), -1.2% for CDL HOSPITALITY TRUSTS (SGX:J85) and -0.7% for ASCOTT RESIDENCE TRUST (SGX:HMN). The impact is limited so far with the exception of FAR EAST HOSPITALITY TRUST\u00a0which was down 5.2% since 20 Jan, partly due to profit-taking. See S-REIT share price performance.",
      "Recall that during the worse period of the SARS outbreak in 2003, hotel occupancy plummeted 32.3 ppt to 42.4% in Q2, but soon recovered to 73.6% in Q3 after the situation improved and returned to the pre-SARS level of 77.0% in Q4. In terms of average room rate, it dropped 17% from S$126 in Oct 2002 (before the first case of SARS was reported in Nov 2002) to the lowest rate of S$105.2 in May 2003. In contrast to the quick rebound of visitor arrivals and occupancy, average room rate remained soft and took longer to recover to the pre-SARS rate.",
      "Looking at the sector as a whole, we still expect RevPAR pickup in 4Q19 but could potentially see a slower pickup or even negative RevPAR growth in 2020 should the travel ban fail to control the virus spread and the situation further escalates. However, given\n\na more resilient market this time with more advanced controls and experience from the SARS crisis,\nbenign room supply which is expected to grow at a lower CAGR of 1.3% for the next 4 years, and\na number of biennial events in Singapore this year, we remain constructive on the hospitality sector.\n\n",

      "benign room supply which is expected to grow at a lower CAGR of 1.3% for the next 4 years, and",
      "a number of biennial events in Singapore this year, we remain constructive on the hospitality sector.",
      "Our top pick remains ASCOTT RESIDENCE TRUST (SGX:HMN) [BUY; FV: S$1.41]. We like ASCOTT RESIDENCE TRUST\u2019s geographically diversified portfolio of high quality assets, and view its defensive positioning favourably, given the still uncertain outlook."

      "\nSARS \u2013 11 Feb 2003",
      "The SARS outbreak hit Singapore in Feb 2003 and claimed 33 lives. There was a knee-jerk sell-off across regional markets in the first week. However, one month after the SARS outbreak, most markets recovered, with the exception of Singapore and HK as the two countries took a while longer to recover due to high incidence of SARS cases.",
      "During the period of 18 Nov 2002 to 11 Mar 2003, MSCI Singapore dropped by 14%. From 10 Feb 2002, when media started to report death count, to the bottom of the market on 11 Mar 2003, Singapore market dropped by 6%. It fell by another 6% in the month from 25 Mar 2003 when Singapore reported its first SARS death case. As such, we estimate 6-12% downside risk for the index from the current levels.",
      "The biggest losers during the period from Nov 02 to Mar-03 were economic proxies such as developers (c.-19%) and banks (c.-22% y-o-y). SIA (SGX:C6L)\u2019s share price fell 11% as the impact on its earnings was significant. Passenger traffic fell 35% y-o-y in 2QCY03 at the peak of the SARS crisis. Revenue fell 35% y-o-y to S$1.6bn, while it reported a net loss of S$312m (2QCY02: net profit of S$478m). However, by 2QCY04, SIA\u2019s revenue rebounded by 65% (lower than passenger traffic growth of 97% y-o-y due to fare discounts and promotions), while it recovered into the black to report a net profit of S$255m (albeit lower than 2QCY02\u2019s net profit). Overall tourist arrivals in Singapore declined 19% y-o-y with RevPAR down 17% y-o-y on the back of lower occupancy (-7.2% pts y-o-y) and average daily rate (-8.3% y-o-y). 2003 GDP growth came down to only 1.1% in 2003.",
      "We would like to highlight that the market has become increasingly immune to event-driven shocks since 2003 as global governments are more prepared for public-health emergencies We would bargain hunt if the market weakens in the near term.",
      "\nAvian Influenza 10 Jan 2006 and 1 April 2013",
      "No cases were detected in Singapore, either in humans or poultry, but authorities remained vigilant on cases in Malaysia. Hospitals prepared H7N9 detection kits for potential cases. MSCI Singapore fell 14% from market peak to trough (3 May-14 June 2006) and was down 12% from 20 May - 24 June 2013 with no specific proxy sectors affected by the virus. We believe this was more due to the general weak sentiment in May.",
      "In 2003, the Singapore government rolled out a S$230m SARS relief package to help industries that had been more severely impacted, particularly the tourism and transport-related industries. Some measures included additional 30% rebates on airport landing fees, property tax relief for commercial properties such as hotels, shops and restaurants, as well as lower levy paid by employers on foreign workers they hired.",
      "Some of the efforts that are likely in the case of a prolonged outbreak are as follows:-\n\nStepping up health screening efforts at all international entry points\nImposing travel restrictions or advisories to and from countries that have influenza outbreaks\nIssuing public advisory calling for targeted groups of people to get flu vaccinations\nIncreasing resources such as isolation facilities in hospitals and stockpiling medicine. Front-line healthcare workers in hospital and polyclinic settings will be given anti-viral prophylaxis for the duration of the pandemic.\n\n",

      "\nPotential beneficiaries",
      "The continued negative newsflow from the pandemic through Chinese New Year could be a catalyst for glove manufacturers such as Riverstone (SGX:AP4). Glove makers could see a rise in demand if the outbreak is prolonged and turns into a global pandemic. We witnessed this during the SARS outbreak in 2003 and avian flu in 2009. We estimate that global glove demand rose 10-13% in 2003 and 2009 (vs. 8% p.a. in 2000-18). Riverstone derives c.70% of its revenue from healthcare gloves. Currently, our base case assumptions factor in mid-teen volume growth for its healthcare gloves in FY20F, driven by enhanced awareness about hygiene and healthcare standards without any major virus outbreak.",
      "Healthcare providers and producers of medical gloves could be potential beneficiaries depending on the extent and length of the outbreak. During SARS, there was a positive share price reaction for Raffles Medical Group (SGX:BSL), as it was appointed by the immigration and checkpoint authorities (Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, and Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore) to conduct screening for fever and other symptoms at the air, land and sea border checkpoints. We also note that the official opening of Raffles Hospital in March 2002 could have been another share price driver. If the novel coronavirus continues to escalate and proves to be as severe as SARS, we think this could also benefit Raffles Medical Group in terms of redirection of patient footfall (from public hospitals), at both its Singapore and China hospitals.",
      "\nMost vulnerable",
      "The most vulnerable sectors are aviation, gaming, hospitality and consumer discretionary and ones with China exposure. For SIA (SGX:C6L), we expect a SARS-like impact on its passenger traffic and financial performance if the epidemic sweeps across Asia. SIA would not only see passenger load factors decline considerably, it would also have to slash airfares in order to incentivise passengers to fly again, while much of its operating costs are fixed in the short term. SIA can take mitigating actions like cancelling selected flight frequencies, and implementing a no-pay leave policy for staff or cutting staff allowances. In addition, SIA may be able to claim some assistance from the Singapore government and/or some incentives from airports, although these would only partially offset the negative impact on its bottomline, in our view. Unlike in 2003, when the SIA Group operated with only two brands \u2013 the flagship SIA full service carrier and its regional subsidiary SilkAir \u2013 the group now has a well-established low-cost brand named Scoot. As a result, we expect the SIA Group to be able to cope better with any epidemic-like contagion, as it can use low-cost carrier Scoot to drive traffic via fare discounts.",
      "SATS (SGX:S58)\u2019s inflight catering dropped 14% y-o-y and ground handling -10% y-o-y during the SARS outbreak on the back of cancellation and suspension of many flights during the first quarter after the outbreak.",
      "Hospitality names such as Far East Hospitality Trust (SGX:Q5T) could see the largest impact given its 41% of variable income exposure to Singapore. This is followed by CDL Hospitality Trusts (SGX:J85) which has 32% variable income exposure in Singapore. The impact on Ascott Residence Trust (SGX:HMN) should be less severe as 27% of its revenue is generated from China, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Based on our sensitivity analysis, a 1% pt decline in tourist arrivals in Singapore will reduce our industry RevPAR assumption by 1% pt, and a decline of 1% pt in RevPAR/RevPAU will reduce our Far East Hospitality Trust and CDL Hospitality Trusts\u2019s FY20 DPU forecasts by 1% and 0.3% respectively. Consumer discretionary proxies such as city shopping malls and outlet malls are also at risk, including Starhill Global REIT (SGX:P40U) and SPH REIT (SGX:SK6U).",
      "Companies with significant China exposure may be impacted, including Dairy Farm International (SGX:D01). In 2003, Hong Kong\u2019s retail sales value decline 2.3% y-o-y and tourist arrivals declined 6.2% y-o-y. Dairy Farm International also specifically mentioned that SARS had reduced sales at its Maxim's (restaurant associate earnings fell -30% y-o-y) and 7-11 stores. Given the heightened risks of further declines in retail sales and tourist arrivals amidst protests, Dairy Farm International's North Asia revenues and EBIT (65% of 1H19 revenue/~90% of 1H19 EBIT) as well as restaurant earnings (~20% of 1H19 net profit) could suffer a double whammy effect.",
      "CapitaLand (SGX:C31) had 41% of its 3Q19 operating EBIT from China. CapitaLand Retail China Trust (SGX:AU8U) has 100% of portfolio based in China with one mall in Wuhan. Sasseur REIT (SGX:CRPU) also has 100% of its portfolio in China but no outlet in Wuhan. Mapletree Logistics Trust (SGX:M44U) has 24 properties in China out of its 144 total, making up 9% of AUM and 11% of 1HFY3/20 gross revenue. In terms of Wuhan exposure, it has a 50% stake in the Mapletree Wuhan Yangluo Logistics Park which forms c.0.4% of the total group gross revenue in 1HFY3/20F. There is no historical share price impact evidence during 2003 SARS/2005-2006 Avian flu as Mapletree Logistics Trust was listed in 2007.

      "At SINGAPORE AIRLINES (SIA, SGX:C6L)\u2019s analyst briefing and post-results luncheon last week, the SIA team described how it was continuing to push forward at multiple levels.",
      "Product upgrades at SIA/SilkAir underpin the full-service brand, even as SilkAir/Scoot struggle with technical challenges not of their own making.",
      "Maintain HOLD with unchanged target price of S$10, still based on 0.9x P/BV, 1 s.d. below the mean since 2001, as economic headwinds begin to blow in.",
      "SIA group\u2019s 3-year transformation plan since 2017 has had a major impact on SIA mainline, the flagship full-service carrier (FSC) in the group, with the revenue management system helping to push up its local currency yields by 3.6% y-o-y during 1HFY20, although S$ appreciation against major revenue currencies reduced the yield upside to only 1% y-o-y.",
      "Non-stop US flights have helped to lift premium demand on connecting short-haul sectors such as India/Indonesia to Singapore.",
      "Passenger load factors reached an all-time high of 85.9% for SIA mainline, as the new revenue management system prescribed a successful strategy of lowering yields in exchange for even higher traffic, with the net result of higher overall revenue per unit of capacity.",
      "On the product front, SIA mainline will introduce a new generation of cabin products once the 777X begins delivery in 2022F (to replace the 777-300ERs), while SilkAir will also retrofit its existing 737-800NGs (and eventually its MAX 8s) with a new short-haul product.",
      "See Singapore Airlines Announcements; Singapore Airlines Latest News.",
      "SilkAir\u2019s 6 x 737 MAX 8 planes were grounded since Mar 2019, while Scoot now has two 787-9s grounded due to TRENT 1000 engine issues. These issues have affected aircraft productivity and increased both airlines\u2019 unit costs. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel.",
      "The US/EU aviation regulators will likely permit the reactivation of commercial flights for the MAX 8s from Dec/Jan, to be followed in due course by Asian regulators. After retraining its pilots on the MCAS system, SilkAir may be able to reactivate its MAX 8 fleet sometime next year, in our view.",
      "Meanwhile, one of Scoot\u2019s grounded 787-9s has just been fitted with new engines, while the other plane should be fitted in six months\u2019 time.",
      "Separately, while Scoot has had teething issues after taking over several routes from SilkAir, we believe that they will be resolved in time, helping Scoot boost its yields.",
      "While SIA group\u2019s structural costs have risen, its new A350/787 fleet has helped improve fuel efficiency by almost 30% when compared to legacy models. It is also continuing to develop deep commercial airline partnerships, with the latest being with Malaysia Airlines. Vistara continues to push ahead with its international route expansion, and took advantage of Jet Airways\u2019 demise in several ways, while new management at Virgin Australia can hopefully help to address its ongoing losses.",
      "SIA group is also pushing ahead to build ancillary businesses like KrisShop and KrisFlyer. Finally, SIA is pushing to develop the NDC platform for ticket sales that promises to reduce distribution costs.",
      "Local fares across the SIA mainline network have improved by 3.6% y-o-y for 1HFY20, but after accounting for S$-appreciation against revenue currencies (such as the Australian dollar, euro and Chinese renminbi), SIA mainline\u2019s yields were \u2018only\u2019 1% higher y-o-y.",
      "The strong yield performance was due to the following reasons.\n\nThe new revenue management system that was put in place in 2017, has worked well to price fares dynamically at levels that customers would be willing to accept.\nStrong premium travel demand has more than offset weaker economy class yields.\nNon-stop direct US flights have helped improve the load factors of the premium cabins on short-haul flights from India-Singapore and Indonesia- Singapore, and to the extent that short-haul flights have higher yield, the overall SIA yield also rises. Furthermore, the non-stop US flights on the A350-900ULR have a higher premium content, as there are no economy class seats, only business and premium economy seats.\n\n",
      "The new revenue management system that was put in place in 2017, has worked well to price fares dynamically at levels that customers would be willing to accept.",
      "Strong premium travel demand has more than offset weaker economy class yields.",

Furthermore, the non-stop US flights on the A350-900ULR have a higher premium content, as there are no economy class seats, only business and premium economy seats.",
      "SIA disclosed that since the launch of the direct Singapore-US flights, SIA\u2019s weekly frequencies to the US have increased by 16 flights, passengers to the US have increased 35%, and SIA\u2019s market share from Singapore to the US has risen by 21% pts.",
      "Also, SIA gained market share on regional flows to the US (via Singapore). For instance, SIA\u2019s market share on flows from Southeast Asia (ex- Singapore) to the US rose by 1% pt, market share from India to the US West Coast rose 2% pts, and market share from Southwest Pacific (Australia and New Zealand) to the US East Coast rose 1% pt.",
      "SIA said that it was still seeing healthy premium bookings across all the major markets, especially for US long-haul, non-stop flights. The IT and professional services sectors are still doing well, even though the finance sector may be a bit muted. While the manufacturing sector and the physical movement of goods may be affected by trade wars, the services industries are still doing well and are helping to driving premium passenger traffic demand.",
      "SIA mainline will introduce its 777X replacement for its 777-300ERs in 2022F, with cabin-leading products, hence keeping its tight grasp on product quality and rankings among premium travellers.",
      "SIA mainline\u2019s passenger load factor (PLF) hit a historic high of 85.9% in 2QFY20F, which is another significant achievement. For its economy class cabins, SIA mainline has been willing to price competitively to build load factors, as lower yields have resulted in higher overall revenues since passenger demand has increased by more than the decline in yields.",
      "On the other hand, there is an inverse correlation between SIA\u2019s net promoter score (loyalty of its customers) against the PLF, hence SIA needs to balance these two objectives.",
      "SilkAir has not been doing too well lately because of the issues surrounding the grounding of its 6 x 737 MAX 8s. The SIA group saw \u2018other passenger revenue\u2019 decline in 1HFY20 due to lower charter flights revenue, mainly because SilkAir had no excess aircraft to lease out to third-party operators given that its 6 x 737 MAX 8s have been grounded.",
      "Also, SilkAir continues to incur maintenance costs and depreciation costs for the 737 MAX 8 planes, which are currently parked in the Australian desert in Alice Springs. The planes were flown there in October because the humid climate in Singapore made it difficult to maintain.",
      "The reactivation of the 737 MAX 8s will depend on regulatory approval in Asia, not just the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US. The FAA will likely allow the 737 MAX 8 to resume flying in December 2019, and the European regulators have agreed on a preliminary basis to allow reactivation in January 2020. The reactivation of SilkAir\u2019s 737 MAX 8 fleet will likely depend on their recertification by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and other regional aviation regulators in Asia and Australia which could take several months. In addition, it may also take a number of months to train SilkAir\u2019s pilots to operate the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which is at the heart of the issue behind the two 737 MAX 8 plane crashes. In our view, it may be possible for SilkAir to reactivate its 6 x 737 MAX 8 planes sometime during 2020F if all goes well on the regulatory front.",
      "On a separate note, SilkAir is finalising upgrading of seats on its 737-800NG planes to the new short-haul product that was actually intended to be fitted on the currently-grounded 737 MAX 8 fleet. Apart from the 6 x 737 MAX 8 planes that had already been delivered, SilkAir also has a further 31 orders for the aircraft type. The current MAX 8 product has recliner business-class seats and no seatback In-Flight Entertainment (IFE). SilkAir had originally intended to retrofit all of its existing MAX 8 planes with lie-flat business-class seats and seatback IFE on all seats, and equip all the new MAX 8 deliveries with the same product, so as to standardise the product with SIA mainline prior to a full merger of the two brands. The MAX 8 planes would then be the cornerstone SilkAir product, with SilkAir planning to transfer 14 x 737-800NGs to Scoot (which will be retrofitted to an LCC product) and to retire the remaining 3 x 737-800NGs.",
      "However, the subsequent issues with the MAX 8 planes put paid to SilkAir\u2019s original plans, such that the 14 x 737-800NGs will no longer be transferred to Scoot, but will instead be retained by SilkAir. Because the merger with SIA mainline is still on the cards, SilkAir will proceed to retrofit the 737-800NGs with the new short-haul product that was originally intended for the MAX 8s. When the MAX 8s are reinstated to full service, SilkAir will presumably retrofit those as well. The timeline for the 14 x 737-800NG product retrofit was not disclosed, but we expect these to be done on a progressive basis over the next 1-2 years.",
      "Scoot had three major issues in the past six months or more which had impacted its profitability. The first issue has been the technical problems with the TRENT 1000 engines that are fitted on its 10 x 787-9 aircraft. The second issue lies with the teething problems faced when it started taking over several SilkAir routes. And the final issue is with slowing outbound Chinese travel demand and the heightened competition with the Chinese carriers which had deployed more capacity to Southeast Asia.",
      "In relation to the first issue, Scoot has had two \u2018gliders\u2019 for the past two months, i.e. 787-9s that have had their TRENT 1000 engines removed to enable a technical fix by Rolls-Royce. The shortfall in capacity caused lengthy flight delays in late-2018 when technical problems affected other planes, causing serious passenger dissatisfaction which was played up in the media and caused Singapore-origin bookings to fall. In response to these problems, Scoot decided to increase the number of spare planes and to reduce the aircraft utilisation from 13+ hours a day to 11+ hours, down 15%. This caused non-fuel unit costs to rise due to the lower ASK production and fleet inefficiency. However, Scoot saw this move as necessary to restore passenger confidence.",
      "The technical issues surrounding the TRENT 1000 engines are in the process of achieving a near-term resolution. One of the two \u2018gliders\u2019 has just been re-fitted with engines. The second aircraft will still need a further six months to return to service. However, as the engines age, Scoot has to do more inspections for the blades and the drums, which can be time consuming. A more permanent resolution will be available when Rolls-Royce readies newly-certified parts to be installed on the fleet of 10 x TRENT 1000 engines (Scoot has 10 x 787-9 aircraft in its fleet); however, this may not be available so quickly and Scoot will have to remain on guard for any technical issues that may arise in the future. Thankfully, Scoot\u2019s fleet of 10 x 787-8s are not affected as they are fitted with different engines.",
      "In terms of the second issue, Scoot is in the process of taking over the SilkAir routes, having already taken over seven routes up to 30 September 2019, with another 10 route transfers to be completed by June 2020. However, Scoot has had some teething issues when taking over the routes. Scoot had issues building demand for all the new routes taken over from SilkAir, as Scoot\u2019s aircraft seat capacity is larger and Scoot needed to discount fares to build demand. Scoot deployed larger-capacity narrow-bodies on these ex-SilkAir routes, with 180 all-economy class seats on the A320s, against SilkAir\u2019s 150- seat A320s or 162-seat 737-800NGs. The larger seat capacity required Scoot to discount its prices in order to clear the seat inventory.",
      "Separately, Scoot also needed to remarket the flights as LCC flights instead of full-service carrier (FSC) flights, working with different sales agents as that of SilkAir\u2019s, using different ground handlers, and other kinds of new infrastructure needs that have been established by Scoot.",
      "In terms of the third issue, while there has been no incremental worsening in the level of competition with Chinese carriers, the capacity that the latter has deployed to Southeast Asia remains intact, and the market still needs time to absorb the capacity. The slowdown in Chinese outbound travel due to the weaker renminbi and weaker economic growth has not helped.",
      "SIA said that the China-US and Europe-Asia cargo markets have become weaker for its cargo business in recent months. SIA retains its bearish view on the airfreight markets, saying that it does not see signs of an upturn, and excess capacity that had been in place since the airfreight boom in 2017-18 is still in place and is now placing pressure on cargo yields.",
      "The SIA group has incurred higher staff costs due to headcount increase, higher pay/allowance rates for cabin crew and pilots, higher crew allowances due to non-stop services to the US, increased flying hours, and higher provisions for bonuses due to the higher PLF.",
      "The SIA group has taken onto its balance sheet 26 more planes y-o-y, hence causing depreciation expense to rise, although this has been mitigated by the return of 10 planes to lessors, with a net fleet increase of 16 planes.",
      "SIA has raised more borrowings to finance aircraft purchases, resulting in higher interest costs. Interest and depreciation costs also rose due to IFRS 16 implementation from 1 April 2019, which saw a reallocation of operating lease charges into their respective interest and depreciation components.",
      "Group sales costs rose 14.8% due to higher commissions, advertising, fees, transaction costs paid to various booking engines, as building business for the future. SIA has pushed sales by incentivising agents through higher commission rates. Advertising spend has increased in relation to new routes such as Busan and Seattle.",
      "Meanwhile, SIA has \u201cstruggled\u201d with suppliers in monopoly positions such as payment gateways, credit card companies, where their rates are being raised.",
      "The structurally-higher non-fuel costs enumerated above have been partially offset by an increase in fuel efficiency as a result of SIA group\u2019s newest-technology planes.",
      "SIA mainline maintains deep commercial partnerships with Virgin Australia, Air New Zealand, Lufthansa, and SAS, with the newest addition being Malaysia Airlines (MAS).",
      "The SIA group and MAS announced a commercial tie-up on 30 October 2019, which involves SIA mainline, SilkAir, Scoot, MAS and Firefly (MAS\u2019s turboprop operator). The tie-up requires regulatory approvals from the competition authorities in both Malaysia and Singapore.",
      "The commercial tie-up involves the following:\n\nOn all flights between Malaysia and Singapore, SIA group and MAS group will revenue share, coordinate their flight schedules, and offer \u201cjoint fare products\u201d.\nMAS will codeshare on SIA group\u2019s flights to Malaysia, Europe and South Africa, and other international destinations to be introduced in the future.

AirAsia X also recently deployed widebody A330s on the KL-Singapore route, increasing LCC capacity on the route.

      "While the deep commercial partnership with MAS is positive, we think that the positive impact for the SIA group may be limited for the time being because:\n\nNot many Malaysians travel to South Africa, so the incremental passenger contribution to the SIA network is minimal. As for Europe, Malaysians tend to prefer flights by Gulf carriers like Emirates, Etihad or Qatar, because travelling south to the Singapore hub is a diversion before backtracking to the north.\nSIA group\u2019s network in Asia-Pacific and Australia has not been included in the new codesharing arrangement, because MAS already has a good network within these geographies.\nStrangely, SIA mainline\u2019s direct flights to the US are also not included in the new codesharing arrangement, at least for now. This is potentially one of the areas which SIA group will include in the future expansion of codesharing. Malaysians flying to the US have to take one-stop flights via hubs in North Asian, Middle Eastern, or Europe, so a one-stop in Singapore makes the SIA one-stop offering to the US no worse off than other options available to Malaysians.\nFinally, we do not think that codeshare domestic flights by MAS to the 12 new Malaysian cities will see much demand among SIA\u2019s customers, because these are secondary or tertiary cities.\n\n",

      "In conclusion, we think that the new SIA-MAS commercial agreement is beneficial in terms of coordinating schedules and sharing revenues for flights for the full-service carriers between Singapore and KL/Penang/KK/Kuching. This will reduce flight overlap, spread out flights throughout the day, and increase load factors for specific flights for both airlines. This will also help the FSCs improve their fleet deployment efficiencies in an environment where LCCs are constantly keeping fares low. However, we think that the bigger beneficiary will be MAS group, because it can ride on SIA/SilkAir\u2019s superior product.",
      "On the other hand, SIA/SilkAir customers may see service deterioration if they are forced to sit in an MAS/Firefly plane in that specific travel time slot. Overall, we do not expect the benefits to be significant to either MAS group or SIA group.",
      "Vistara\u2019s 1HFY20 net losses rose slightly vs. 1HFY19, as it had recruited 500 staff from Jet Airways, took over Jet Airways\u2019 9 x B737-800NG, increased its domestic routes network, and launched international flights. This was partially offset by higher domestic yields after the demise of Jet Airways from April 2019. Vistara currently flies to 34 destinations, including three international routes (Singapore, Bangkok and Dubai) with Colombo starting soon. Vistara will have 42 aircraft by March 2020F (vs. 22 planes in March 2019), with 2 x 787-9s, 6 x A320neos and 1 x A321neo to be delivered soon.",
      "Virgin Australia continues to make losses in its international business and on its Tigerair Australia business, although its domestic business is profitable (which is not surprising given that the domestic market is a duopoly with Qantas). SIA has a 20% equity stake in Virgin Australia, so it continues to account for its share of Virgin Australia\u2019s losses. Nevertheless, Virgin Australia has a new CEO and management team, and which will need some time to tackle the underlying issues. In the meantime, SIA continues to benefit from the flow of traffic feed from the partnership with Virgin Australia, and can also offer SIA\u2019s passengers more destinations in Australia through the code sharing arrangement.",
      "\nKrisShop",
      "KrisShop became a 70% subsidiary of the SIA group in December 2018, and its revenue is now recognised under the \u201cothers\u201d category.",
      "SIA reported that KrisShop is heading towards an annual revenue of S$60m, up 30% y-o-y. However, we believe that the profit margins are likely thin.",
      "KrisFlyer has evolved from being managed by third-party service providers, to being managed internally by SIA, and it has transformed from being a sales channel for the captive in-flight audience, to an \u201comni-channel e-commerce player\u201d with its own website that is offering a growing product range with over 5,000 items for sale from more than 350 brands.",
      "\nKrisFlyer",
      "The KrisFlyer membership has risen to over 4m in FY19, and it delivered 18% y-o-y growth in revenue to over S$700m in FY19, with a similar pace of growth expected for FY20F. Over 70% of this revenue was generated from over 200 partners. SIA is targeting to keep growing KrisFlyer by tying up more merchants. The KrisPay platform has also been introduced to enable KrisFlyer members to utilise their frequent flyer miles to redeem everyday items.",
      "In general, frequent flier programmes earn revenue by charging merchants for the points awarded to the latter\u2019s customers. These merchants offer KrisFlyer miles to their customers in exchange for their patronage, and part of the revenue earned by the merchants is used to pay for the KrisFlyer points that are awarded to those merchants\u2019 customers. KrisFlyer records the cash received from the merchants as unearned revenue (booked in the balance sheet as a liability), and once the points are used to redeem SIA flights or other goods/services, KrisFlyer will derecognise the unearned revenue and transfer the equivalent sum to revenue. KrisFlyer then pays the airline or the merchants for the cost of the flight or the goods/services purchased from the points, and the difference is recognised as profits.",
      "SIA spoke in more detail about its adoption of the New Distribution Capability (NDC) and how it may help to reduce its distribution costs.",
      "Currently, there are only 4 Global Distribution Systems (GDS) globally, and some of them are specific to markets in China and Japan. Airlines rely on GDSs to distribute their seat inventory to travel agents around the world, and GDSs control the visibility of seat inventory to potential air travellers.",
      "In order to gain more control over sales and to increase personalisation of the offers to passengers, SIA is pushing a new set of standards and infrastructure which IATA has developed, called NDC. SIA targets to have 20% of its business booked through NDC in the next 12 months. SIA says that it is still in the very early stages of NDC implementation, but NDC may eventually lower unit distribution costs for SIA, and drive more relevant content to passengers.",
      "Traditional GDS systems offer seat bookings on specific flights for travel agents, but cannot offer other ancillary services like seat selection, meal bookings, etc. On the other hand, airline websites can offer the entire suite of ancillary services. On behalf of their customers, travel agents are asking for more features, and GDSs have to respond by linking their systems to airlines\u2019 NDC systems.",
      "The link is enabled by an interface called KrisConnect, which is an Application Programming Interface (API) that acts as an enabler to link SIA\u2019s NDC to various GDS systems. In this way, the travel agents have access not just to seats but also to the ancillary services, and GDSs can enhance their offerings to the travel agents. The end result is for SIA to ultimately negotiate down the GDS booking fees.",
      "We maintain our HOLD recommendation, with an unchanged target price of S$10, still pegged to P/BV of 0.9x (1 s.d. below mean). With the cargo business remaining weak, there is a risk that premium passenger demand that has underpinned SIA\u2019s profitability so far this year will eventually come under some pressure. See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price.",
      "There is a historical lagged correlation between cargo demand and the demand for premium-cabin and business-related travel, which poses a downside risk.",
      "Upside risks include the potential for SilkAir to rethink its long-term capacity growth by renegotiating the 737 MAX 8 orders with Boeing.",

      "Net profit grew 68% y-o-y to S$94.5m, as associates and joint ventures\u2019 showed improvement in results (mainly from Virgin Australia) with losses narrowed from S$117.6m to S$39.8m in 2QFY20. The growth was partially offset by higher net finance charges (+1.6% y-o-y), due to the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases and additional financing for fleet renewal and expansion.",
      "Passenger growth was strong in 2QFY20 across all airlines, with record 2Q and 1HFY20 pax load factor (PLF). Operating performances of the airlines were generally helped by higher traffic growth but dragged by higher expenditures (largely from non-fuel costs), which in turn led to operating loss of S$3m (flat y-o-y) and S$36m (vs S$11m in 2QFY19) for SilkAir and Scoot respectively, as well as lower operating profit (-1.7% y-o-y ) for SIA parent airline.",
      "Singapore Airlines parent airline and SilkAir saw improvements in RASK in 1HFY20, showing that the recovery is on track. SilkAir was adversely affected by the transfer of routes to Scoot as well as the 737 Max grounding, yet it managed to drive growth in revenue, boosted by traffic growth of 3.1%.",
      "Scoot\u2019s traffic grew more rapidly at 7% as it was able to capture more routes from SilkAir. Management noted the challenges to build the brand name in new routes and the lingering issues with SilkAir\u2019s Rolls-Royce engines but believed that they are transitional issues.",
      "Passenger bookings in the coming months remain healthy and are expected to be stronger y-o-y, particularly driven by the long-haul flights to US. We expect the flown revenue to remain the key growth driver and higher revenue contribution from KrisShop in 2HFY20. However, cargo revenue remains a concern and rising expenditure may be a short-term drag, given Singapore Airlines\u2019s strategy to grow in capacity with 159 outstanding aircraft deliveries to support fleet renewal and expansion.",
      "Nonetheless, we believe that this is beneficial to the Group in the long run. The new aircrafts could improve fuel efficiency by 26-30% and also give the Group the capability to operate into new markets such as the long haul market.",
      "After adjustments to factor in the weak cargo and higher expenditure, our fair value decreases from S$11.02 to S$10.46. See Singapore Airlines Share Price; Singapore Airlines Target Price."

SINGAPORE AIRLINES (SIA, SGX:C6L) guided cargo traffic to remain weak and it has cut cargo capacity. We also did not receive any assurance that costs are likely to stabilise in 2HFY20.",

      "Earnings below expectation amid continued losses from Virgin Australia and higher opex. SINGAPORE AIRLINES (SIA, SGX:C6L)\u2019s 2QFY20 net profit at S$94.5m was sharply below our estimate. We had expected parent airline\u2019s operating profit to rise 36% y-o-y but it declined 1.7% y-o-y in the quarter due to a steep 8.4% y-o-y decline in cargo yield. Scoot\u2019s losses also rose more than three-fold amid a 7% y-o-y increase in opex for the period. However, the bulk of the earnings estimate variance was due to continued associate losses. SIA made a S$116m provision for Virgin Australia (VA) in the prior quarter. Excluding SIA Engineering (SGX:S59)\u2019s consolidated associate, associate loss would have been S$67.5m, which implies continued losses at VA, Vistara or NokScoot. SIA declared an unchanged 8 S cent interim dividend. See\u00a0Singapore Airlines Dividend History.",
      "Earnings were also impacted by weaker cargo revenue; SIA not optimistic of cargo recovery in the next few quarters. In 2QFY20, cargo revenue declined by S$93m vs 1QFY20\u2019s S$44.6m decline, impacting parent airline\u2019s profitability. Going forward, SIA expects yields to remain depressed due to excess capacity and it will cut cargo capacity to - 1% from prior guidance of 2-3% growth.",
      "Virgin Australia losses could be lower in 2HFY20. About half of Virgin Australia\u2019s losses in 1HFY20 was due to impairment charges on VA\u2019s international and Tigerair\u2019s businesses. The carrier, which has a new management, announced domestic capacity cuts, 750 job cuts and cessation of flights to Hong Kong in a bid to boost profitability. SIA has also not injected additional capital into VA in 1HFY20.",

See Singapore Airlines Announcements; Singapore Airlines Latest News.",
      "SIA\u2019s share of associate losses amounted to S$40m in 2QFY20 which may have been caused by Virgin Australia and Vistara, against S$2m share of loss in 2QFY19 (with the latter figure excluding S$116m share of Virgin Australia\u2019s deferred tax asset write-off which we had reclassified into the exceptional line).",
      "The cargo arm suffered its second consecutive quarter of yield decline, following global demand weakness since late-2018.",
      "Scoot was impacted by competition with Chinese carriers which reduced its yields and RASK, while its CASK rose as it had to scale back aircraft utilisation to tackle schedule reliability problems caused by the TRENT 1000 engines on its 9 x 787-9 fleet.",

      "More than a week has passed post the 14 September attack on two key oil assets in Saudi Arabia that curtailed around half of the country\u2019s oil production capacity \u2013 equivalent to shutting down both Brazil\u2019s and Kuwait\u2019s oil production.",
      "In our view, the attack is a game-changer as it used inexpensive and undetectable drones that managed to knock out 5% of global oil production, if only temporarily. This feat cannot be underestimated and we expect a US$2-4/bbl risk premium on oil prices in the near to medium term.",
      "In our view, oil prices will continue to be buffeted by newsflow of when the Saudis will be able to get the lost production back up and running.",
      "\nImpact on Asia.",
      "Reuters reported that as a result of damage to its facilities, Saudi Aramco has to delay oil shipments to Asian oil refiners and replace light crude with medium to heavy grades. Asian refiners import 70% of their crude oil requirements from Saudi Aramco and fortunately are complex enough to deal with the lower-quality oil.",
      "While there are no listed refiners here in Singapore, there are oil-related plays whose share prices show a reasonably high correlation with the Brent oil price.",

However, if we look at a slightly longer timeframe of five years, the STI surprisingly comes out as the most correlated with an R of 0.657 while KEPPEL CORPORATION (SGX:BN4) again makes an appearance, as do SEMBCORP MARINE (SGX:S51), REX INTERNATIONAL (SGX:5WH) and KIMHENG OFFSHORE & MARINE (SGX:5G2).",
      "At the opposite end of the scale, the STI, VALLIANZ (SGX:WPC) and COMFORTDELGRO (SGX:C52) showed little to no correlation to movements in oil prices on a 1-year historical basis. Interestingly, ComfortDelgro\u2019s share price had a meaningful negative correlation to oil prices on a 5-year basis despite only 7% of its revenue being attributable to fuel costs.",
      "One would have expected exploration & production (E&P) companies to be most correlated to oil prices, given that their oil production would directly benefit from higher oil prices.",
      "E&P companies in our sample include INTERRA RESOURCES (SGX:5GI) and RH PETROGAS (SGX:T13), while KRISENERGY (SGX:SK3) is suspended although operationally its current oil production may benefit from higher oil prices.",

      "The carrier is monitoring negative momentum in macroeconomic indicators, including airfreight weakness, that may portend a turn in the aviation cycle.",

See Singapore Airlines - CGS-CIMB 2019-08-01: Share Price Constrained By Mixed Outlook.",
      "We noted in our results report that SIA was not a compelling investment case at Wednesday\u2019s closing price of S$9.67, but after the sell-off today, SIA is once again closing in on its trough P/BV valuation of 0.8x, or S$8.93, which is just 3% lower than the current SIA share price. Nevertheless, we are not upgrading our call to an Add, because the earnings momentum for SIA looks set to decelerate, given the ongoing cargo demand and yield weakness, and an expected delayed flow-through in the future to premium demand and yields.",
      "SIA told analysts that conditions were hunky-dory for the mainline passenger carrier to-date, with premium demand and yields holding up, although economy class yields were under a bit of competitive pressure. Looking three months forward, no weakness has been detected, contrary to Cathay Pacific\u2019s warnings of substantial pressure on long-haul passenger yields in the coming months. However, SIA is worried about the weakening global economic momentum indicators, which had preceded a weakening of business travel demand and yields in the past.",
      "SIA is bearish on the outlook for its cargo business, as the US-China trade war has caused demand to fall while freighter capacity put in place during the cargo boom years of 2017-18 have remained in place, causing oversupply and continuing to put pressure on cargo yields.",
      "SilkAir\u2019s grounding of its six 737 MAX 8 planes caused non-fuel operating costs to escalate, as it continues to depreciate the planes while generating no revenue from them. With multiple regulatory hurdles to clear, SilkAir was unsure when the planes could be reactivated, which means SilkAir\u2019s financial performance might be lacklustre for a while yet.",
      "Meanwhile, Scoot continues to face issues with the reliability of the Rolls-Royce TRENT 1000 engines powering its 787-9 fleet, which had caused lengthy flight delays in the last few months of 2018 and a fall-off at its Singapore point-of-sale. As a result, Scoot has been forced to curtail its aircraft utilisation by 15% or two hours a day, and set aside more spare aircraft, which impacted its planned capacity expansion.",
      "Once the technical issues on the MAX 8 and TRENT 1000 engines are resolved, SilkAir and Scoot will be achieve their true long-term potential.",

Taking that aside, last quarter\u2019s EBIT was flattish y-o-y, with an operating profit improvement at\n\nSIA mainline\u2019s passenger business and at\nSIA Engineering (SGX:S59), largely offset by\nlower cargo profits, and\nlosses at SilkAir and Scoot (vs. breakeven for the latter two airlines in the prior year).\n\n",

      "SilkAir grounded its fleet of six 737 MAX 8 planes on 12 Mar 2019, and 1QFY20 reflected the first full quarter of that impact with an EBIT loss of S$16m, vs. breakeven last year. Costs related to the grounding and loss of revenue from the subsequent reduction of capacity contributed the majority of the loss. This was partly compensated by SilkAir\u2019s third-consecutive quarter of y-o-y RASK increase as passenger demand and loads responded positively to lower yields. The efforts to improve RASK are important because SilkAir had over-expanded by growing ASK capacity 36% over the past four years, which led to a 15% RASK decline over that same period.",
      "During our recent marketing trip to Singapore, many investors asked if there was a case to accumulate SIA shares. At its recent low of S$9.06 on 4 Jun, SIA was certainly very attractive, trading at its trough valuation of 0.8x P/BV, but at the current share price of S$9.67, the upside is no longer so compelling, in our view. See SIA share price history.",
      "Cathay Pacific recently warned of \u201cintense market competition\u201d that \u201ccontinued to exert pressure on yield\u201d especially on long-haul flights. SIA also noted that trade disputes and softer airfreight demand has clouded the outlook for passenger demand over the longer term.",
      "Our HOLD call is premised on weakening global GDP growth and higher tariffs that are now beleaguering the US-China trade and have been negatively affecting SIA\u2019s airfreight demand and yield since late-CY18. There is a historical lagged correlation between cargo demand and demand for premium-cabin and business-related travel, which pose a downside risk.",
      "Upside risks include the potential for SilkAir to rethink its long-term capacity growth by renegotiating the 737 MAX 8 orders with Boeing."

      "Higher-than-expected oil price pose a downside risk. Our target price stays at S$10.14, based on 0.9x CY19 P/BV (1 s.d. below mean).",
      "On 12 Mar 2019, SilkAir grounded its fleet of 6 x 737 MAX 8 planes in response to the Ethiopian Airlines crash of the same aircraft type on 10 Mar. Meanwhile, problems with the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 TEN engines have caused two of SIA mainline\u2019s 11-strong 787-10 fleet, and two of Scoot\u2019s 19-strong fleet of 787-8/9 planes, to be grounded currently. These technical issues have caused a series of problems to the SIA group.\n\nFirst, the groundings caused scheduling headaches and customer satisfaction issues which need to be handled delicately.\nSecond, the groundings may result in rectification costs (which may be compensated by the manufacturers), and the costs of taking on more aircraft leases to meet capacity needs.\nLast, near-term capacity expansion plans have been affected, with the group\u2019s ASK capacity growth plan cut slightly to 6% in FY20F (from 6.4% in FY3/19).\n\n",
      "First, the groundings caused scheduling headaches and customer satisfaction issues which need to be handled delicately.",
      "Second, the groundings may result in rectification costs (which may be compensated by the manufacturers), and the costs of taking on more aircraft leases to meet capacity needs.",
      "Last, near-term capacity expansion plans have been affected, with the group\u2019s ASK capacity growth plan cut slightly to 6% in FY20F (from 6.4% in FY3/19).",
      "SilkAir\u2019s 6.2% ASK growth in FY19 is scheduled to fall by 3% in FY20F, and Scoot\u2019s ASK growth of 15% in FY19 may slow to just 7% in FY20F, partially offset by SIA mainline\u2019s planned growth of 7% in FY20F, up from 4.5% in FY19.",
      "In order to offset capacity losses, SIA mainline reinstated one 777-200 and one A330-300 into its operations, as well as increased the utilisation of its fleet, in order to mount supplementary flights to help SilkAir salvage its schedule, and also to make up for its own 787-10 groundings.",
      "Meanwhile, since the group is still pushing ahead for Scoot to take over 17 routes from SilkAir, but SilkAir will longer transfer 14 x 737-800 planes to Scoot (as SilkAIr requires them to maintain its schedule after the MAX 8 groundings), and Scoot is facing engine issues with its fleet of 787-8/9s, Scoot is looking at extending 4-6 aircraft leases, and lease in an additional 10-12 x A320s over the next two years.",
      "The silver lining is that SilkAir now has the opportunity to renegotiate with Boeing on the remaining 31 x MAX 8s on order. An order cancellation is unlikely, but in our view, SilkAir may negotiate for a hiatus in deliveries as the process of recertifying the MAX 8s may be lengthy, and decisions by multiple aviation regulator will be needed before SilkAir can reinstate its original MAX 8 schedule.",
      "We think SilkAir will attempt to build in a good time buffer to make sure that all issues are fully resolved before delivery resumes. Also, the remaining MAX 8 orders were to have been fully delivered over five years from CY19- 23F, but SilkAir may try to extend the deliveries over a longer period of time, in order to temper its capacity growth in view of current regional overcapacity.",
      "The revenue per unit of Available Seat Kilometre (RASK) capacity for the full-service carrier (FSC) business of SIA mainline and SilkAir have been showing y-o-y growth for five consecutive quarters from the quarter ended December 2017, but then weakened on a y-o-y basis in 4QFY19 (the January-March 2019 quarter).",
      "Based on the explanation from SIA, we do not believe that this is reflective of underlying weakness in the demand environment. SIA noted that the February 2019 RASK was weaker y-o-y because of the shift of outbound Lunar New Year traffic from February 2018 to end-January 2019.",
      "Meanwhile, for March 2019, SIA said that the y-o-y drop in RASK was due to the shift in Easter from end- March 2018 to mid-April 2019. However, SIA did say that the competition in the marketplace was becoming more intense. Also, SIA noted in its recent results release that it has continued to see \u201cgrowth in forward passenger bookings\u201d and \u201crobust premium-cabin demand\u201d.",
      "The revenue per unit of Available Seat Kilometre (RASK) capacity for the low-cost carrier (LCC) business under Scoot has fallen for two-consecutive quarters due to excessive capacity expansion and the consequent fall in passenger load factors, but also because of the expansion of state-owned Chinese carriers into Southeast Asia (in particular to Singapore) that have caused aggressive price competition.",
      "The outlook on Scoot\u2019s RASK will likely continue to be weak for the rest of FY20F, in our view, simply because of the high-base effect, because the competition\u2019s capacity expansion only began in earnest from the quarter ended December 2018, and also because Chinese outbound travel to Southeast Asia has slowed materially in recent months.",
      "However, there is potential for improvement in FY20F, as Scoot terminated poorly-performing flights to Dhaka, Dalian and Honolulu in FY19, and will be terminating loss-making flights to Lucknow and Kalibo from end-June 2019F, to Quanzhou from August, and to Male from October.",
      "These route terminations are to make way for routes that Scoot have been designated to take over from SilkAir, the first of which was to Vientiane via Luang Prabang from 1 April 2019, followed by Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) from 7 May.",
      "Other flights that Scoot will take over include:\n\nBetween May and October 2019F: Coimbatore and Visakhapatnam, India\nBetween May and June 2019F: Changsha, Fuzhou, Kunming and Wuhan, China\nOctober 2019F: Chiang Mai, Thailand (which is already an existing Scoot destination)\nDecember 2019F: Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia\nBetween May and June 2020F: Balikpapan, Lombok, Makassar, Manado, Semarang and Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\n",

      "December 2019F: Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",
      "Between May and June 2020F: Balikpapan, Lombok, Makassar, Manado, Semarang and Yogyakarta, Indonesia.",
      "We believe that these regional routes are better served using high-density LCC configuration planes, as these routes have a high penetration of competitors\u2019 LCC services that have depressed yields to levels that may be uneconomic for SilkAir to serve, given its FSC positioning. With Scoot, however, these routes are a golden opportunity for growth.",
      "Scoot would not have to terminate the above routes if the planned transfers of 14 x 737-800 planes from SilkAir to Scoot take place over the next 12 months or so, but with the groundings of SilkAir\u2019s fleet of 6 x 737 MAX 8 planes, SilkAir will now keep the 737-800 planes in its fleet. As such, the ASK capacity growth for Scoot was guided by management to be 7% in FY20F, a marked slowdown from the 15.1% growth seen in FY19.",
      "Hence, the issues surrounding the 737 MAX 8 planes in SilkAir\u2019s fleet, as well as those on order, have forced Scoot to dial back its growth plans and to exercise greater selectivity on the routes that it chooses to serve \u2013 eliminating loss-making routes and focusing on those that make the most commercial sense, including the regional routes to be taken over from SilkAir. This should be positive for Scoot\u2019s financial performance, in our view.",
      "Over the next two years, Scoot will need to lease in additional planes, perhaps 10-12 A320s, in place of the 14 x 737-800s that were originally scheduled for transfer from SilkAir to Scoot. Also, Scoot is looking at extending 4-6 aircraft leases, both narrow-and wide-bodied planes. This is because Scoot is still going to take over regional routes from SilkAir despite not getting any aircraft transferred from SilkAir.",
      "In 3QFY19, the cargo business\u2019 revenue per unit of Available Freight Tonne Kilometres (RAFTK) was unchanged y-o-y after rising for six-consecutive quarters, and then fell 6.2% y-o-y (and 19.7% q-o-q) due to excessive US inventories and the impact of higher US and Chinese tariffs on goods for each other.",
      "On a monthly basis, RAFTK had been higher y-o-y until October 2018, before being flat on a y-o-y basis in November 2018, and then falling y-o-y from December 2018 onwards, with the February 2019 RAFTK falling by as much as 10.9% y-o-y. During 2018, many importers and exporters frontloaded cargo volumes prior to the implementation of tariffs, but with US businesses now well stocked, it was not surprising that airfreight demand, and consequently cargo yields and RAFTK, fell.",
      "The recent escalation in the tariff rates for the US-China trade, and the global slowdown in GDP growth, portend continued airfreight weakness for the rest of CY19F, in our view.",
      "Our HOLD call is premised on weakening global GDP growth and higher tariffs that are now beleaguering the US-China trade and that is already negatively affecting SIA\u2019s airfreight demand and yield since late-CY18. Although in \u201cthe months ahead\u201d, SIA continues to see \u201cgrowth in forward passenger bookings\u201d and \u201crobust premium-cabin demand\u201d, there is a historical lagged correlation between cargo demand and demand for premium-cabin and business-related travel, which pose a downside risk.",
      "Upside risks include the potential for SilkAir to rethink its long-term capacity growth by renegotiating the 737 MAX 8 orders with Boeing.",
      "Also, spot jet fuel are now above US$80/bbl; our assumption is an average of US$75/bbl for FY20F and US$85/bbl for FY21F due to the expected heightened demand for middle distillates from the implementation of IMO 2020 from 1 Jan 2020.",
      "For FY20F, SIA has hedged 69% of its fuel needs at an average strike price of c.US$75/bbl of jet fuel, so downside protection is reasonably good. A US$5/bbl increase in the price of jet fuel will therefore negatively impact SIA\u2019s core net profit forecast by only 1%.",
      "For FY21-25F, SIA has hedged up to 46% of its fuel needs at an average strike price of between US$58/bbl and US$63/bbl of Brent (or US$73/bbl to US$78/bbl of jet fuel, assuming crack spread of US$15/bbl), and potentially up to 14% of jet fuel at an average strike price of US$77/bbl. Again, downside protection is good.",
      "In recent years, SIA has traded to as low as 0.8x P/BV, and applying that multiple to SIA results implies a S$9 valuation, where the current share price approximately stands. Hence, we do not think that there is significant additional downside to SIA\u2019s share price hereon."

      "SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L)\u2019s FY19 core net profit of S$845m was 33% above our expectations but 17% below Bloomberg consensus.",
      "The outperformance was due to lower-than-expected operating costs, better JV and associate performance and the absence of tax expense in 4QFY19.",
      "Maintain HOLD as we see cyclical headwinds blowing in. Our target price is lowered slightly to S$10.14, based on 0.9x CY19 P/BV (1 s.d. below mean).",
      "SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SIA, SGX:C6L)\u2019s FY19 core net profit of S$845m was 15% lower y-o-y, with weaker performances at all the passenger airlines on the back of higher oil prices, partially offset by stronger cargo earnings as airfreight demand and yields were robust throughout most of FY19.",
      "At the reported net profit level, SIA saw 48% y-o-y lower earnings, mainly due to SIA\u2019s S$116m share of Virgin Australia\u2019s deferred tax asset write-off in 2QFY19 and a S$60m charge for SilkAir\u2019s refleeting and restructuring costs in 4QFY19, both of which we have classified as exceptional items.",
      "SIA Cargo enjoyed two whole years of robust and rising profitability but the dynamics weakened considerably in the past half year. The cargo business suffered a 0.39 Scts unit loss in FY17, calculated as revenue per Available Freight Tonne Km (RAFTK) minus costs per AFTK, but this swung sharply to a 2.15 Scts unit gain in FY18 and a 3.31 Scts unit gain in FY19 on the back of global inventory restocking and efforts to front-load cargo exports to the US prior to the imposition of tariffs on Chinese exports during CY18.",
      "However, in the past two quarters, the unit profitability has weakened. In 3QFY19, the cargo unit gain fell to 4.79 Scts (from 5.79 Scts a year ago), the first y-o-y drop in two years, and in 4QFY19, the cargo unit gain fell to 1.95 Scts (from 3.01 Scts a year ago). RAFTK also fell 6.2% y-o-y in 4QFY19 from zero y-o-y change in 3QFY19 and positive y-o-y momentum in the seven consecutive quarters preceding that.",
      "With US inventories already bloated from the front-loading in CY18 and the rise in both US and Chinese tariffs from May/Jun 2019, we see headwinds for the global airfreight business, which may impact business and premium-class travel demand in the months ahead.",
      "For now, SIA reported that its premium cabin demand remained robust in the months ahead and growth in forward passenger bookings is tracking positively against capacity injection. We worry, however, that this prevailing cyclical strength may not last until the end of this financial year.",
      "Meanwhile, Scoot saw its 2HFY18 EBIT of S$73m drop to a loss of S$5m in 2HFY19 on the back of higher oil prices as well as intensified competition with state-owned Chinese airlines that have introduced new capacity to ASEAN, just as outbound Chinese passenger traffic growth has slowed.",
      "Conversely, SilkAir\u2019s 4QFY19 EBIT improved y-o-y on lower fuel prices and its refleeting exercise to install lie-flat business class seats will improve its competitive position over time.",
      "Upside risks to our call include SIA\u2019s efforts to improve RASK (by triggering a more-than-compensatory increase in demand in response to lower yields) being more successful than expected.",
      "Downside risks include higher-than-expected jet fuel prices and the heating up of the US-China trade war, which may affect demand for airfreight and eventually spill over into demand for business travel."

      "Although SilkAir\u2019s fleet of six Boeing 737 MAX 8 make up 16% of its seat capacity, the net impact of their grounding is nowhere that significant.",
      "By raising aircraft utilisation and with help from SIA mainline, we calculate the net loss of capacity at only 1.5% of SilkAir\u2019s systemwide seat capacity.",
      "Maintain HOLD, with an unchanged target price of S$10.25, based on 0.9x CY19F P/BV (1 s.d. below mean since 2001).",
      "An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight crashed on 10 Mar and similarities with a Lion Air crash of the same model five months previously have led aviation regulators across the world to ground the MAX 8/9 planes.",
      "On 12 Mar, SilkAir grounded its 6 x Boeing MAX 8 planes. Boeing plans to install a software update in Apr, which then needs to be tested. This means that the grounding of the model will not be lifted until at least May, if not later.",
      "See attached PDF report for the list of existing Boeing 737 MAX operators.",
      "Apart from the 6 x MAX 8 planes, SilkAir also has 2 x A319s, 8 x A320s and 17 x 737- 800 \u2018new-generation\u2019 planes. There are no technical issues for the 737-800 planes.",
      "The MAX 8 planes make up 18% of SilkAir\u2019s current fleet but the impact on SilkAir is much smaller than that. We estimate that the MAX 8 flights make up 16% of SilkAir\u2019s seat capacity and 26% of its Available Seat Kilometre (ASK) capacity.",
      "However, with the announced schedule changes for 16-30 Mar, the impact of the MAX 8 grounding will amount to only 1.5% of SilkAir\u2019s systemwide seat capacity as SilkAir has increased the utilisation of its A320 and 737-800 planes and SIA mainline has mounted supplementary widebody flights. Only SIA/SilkAir\u2019s seat capacity to KL, Hyderabad and Wuhan will see mid-teens percentage declines while Phuket will see a mid-single-digit percentage drop.",
      "The MAX 8 planes are envisioned as the cornerstone of its future fleet because SilkAir has orders for a further 31 x MAX planes. Also, SilkAir had planned to retire the existing Airbus fleet and 3 x 737-800 planes and to transfer 14 x 737-800 aircraft and several regional routes to Scoot (originally to be effected between Apr 2019F and 3QCY20F). Once all this is completed, SilkAir will operate only one aircraft type, i.e. the MAX planes, in up to three possible variants (MAX 8/9/10).",
      "Furthermore, SilkAir plans to retrofit its MAX planes with lie-flat business class seats and seatback In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) in order to offer a comparable product with SIA mainline, upon which SilkAir will be formally merged with its parent company into one SIA brand. All these plans, including the delivery of MAX 8 orders from Boeing, retirement/transfer of other models and seat retrofit, will now likely be delayed due to the MAX grounding.",
      "At the same time, it may be possible for SilkAir to claim compensation from Boeing for the MAX groundings, either in the form of a direct cash transfer or discounts on future aircraft deliveries. We think it is too early to assess the long-term impact on SilkAir and the wider SIA group.",
      "SilkAir currently has a fleet of 33 planes, comprising:\n\n2 x A319-100 planes (128 seats),\n8 x A320-200 planes (150 seats),\n17 x B737-800NG planes (\u201cNG\u201d stands for new-generation, 162 seats), and\n6 x B737 MAX 8 planes (156 seats).\n\n",
      "2 x A319-100 planes (128 seats),",
      "8 x A320-200 planes (150 seats),",
      "17 x B737-800NG planes (\u201cNG\u201d stands for new-generation, 162 seats), and",
      "6 x B737 MAX 8 planes (156 seats).",
      "The 737 MAX 8 planes are SilkAir\u2019s newest planes and make up 18% of SilkAir\u2019s fleet by number.",
      "SilkAir has a further 31 orders for the type to be delivered over the next five years, i.e. seven deliveries in 2019F, and six deliveries each in 2020-2023F.",
      "Prior to the grounding of SilkAir\u2019s six Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes on the morning of 12 March 2019, SilkAir operated 64 flights/week using 737 MAX 8 planes to 12 destinations, including:\n\n16 flights/week to India (Bangalore and Hyderabad)\n11 flights/week to China (Chongqing and Wuhan)\n11 flights/week to Thailand (Phuket)\n9 flights/week to Australia (Cairns and Darwin)\n6 flights/week to Nepal (Kathmandu)\n4 flights/week to Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur and Penang)\n4 flights/week to Cambodia (Phnom Penh)\n3 flights/week to Japan (Hiroshima)\n\n",
      "16 flights/week to India (Bangalore and Hyderabad)",
      "11 flights/week to China (Chongqing and Wuhan)",
      "11 flights/week to Thailand (Phuket)",
      "9 flights/week to Australia (Cairns and Darwin)",
      "6 flights/week to Nepal (Kathmandu)",
      "4 flights/week to Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur and Penang)",
      "4 flights/week to Cambodia (Phnom Penh)",
      "3 flights/week to Japan (Hiroshima)",
      "SilkAir\u2019s flights on the 737 MAX 8s make up 16% of SilkAir\u2019s total flight frequencies, 16.1% of its seat capacity and 25.8% of its Available Seat Kilometre (ASK) capacity. Against the SIA group as a whole, which also includes SIA mainline and Scoot, the significance of SilkAir\u2019s 737 MAX 8 flights are diminished to just 3.5% of the sum total of SIA group\u2019s flight frequencies, 2.3% of group seat capacity and 1.7% of group ASK capacity.",
      "The 737 MAX 8 operations have the lowest significance in Malaysia, where they account for only 2-4% of overall group flight frequencies to Kuala Lumpur and Penang. This is because SilkAir also flies to those destinations using other aircraft types, SIA mainline serves KL separately and Scoot also services those two destinations using the low-cost model.",
      "On routes to Bangalore, Phnom Penh and Phuket, SilkAir\u2019s 737 MAX 8 flights make up some 21-24% of group flight frequencies. SilkAir services Phnom Penh and Phuket extensively using other aircraft types while Bangalore is serviced by both SIA mainline and Scoot; Phuket is also serviced by Scoot.",
      "On Hyderabad and Wuhan, the 737 MAX 8 presence is much higher, at 57-65% of group flight frequencies. Wuhan is serviced exclusively by SilkAir but SilkAir also deploys other aircraft types to the destination. SilkAir services Hyderabad using only 737 MAX 8s but Scoot has a separate service to the city.",
      "Finally, the 737 MAX 8s are used by SilkAir to service five cities on an exclusive basis, i.e. Cairns and Darwin in Australia, Chongqing, Hiroshima and Kathmandu. Erstwhile, no other carrier in the SIA group services these cities, and SilkAir does not use other aircraft types to these cities either.",
      "See attached PDF report for details on SilkAir's schedule changes for 16- 30 March due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes.\u00a0"

      "\nSingapore Airlines (SIA) - 3QFY19 Below Due To Tax, But Things Are Under Control",
      "As usual, SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L, SIA)'s management provided a cautious outlook during the 3QFY19 analyst briefing. However, the undertone is they have passed the worst and there are just a few tweaks needed.",
      "The parent airline and cargo business is operating well, whereas the regional short haul suffers from overcapacity and a sudden fall-off of Chinese tourists.",
      "We are confident Singapore Airlines\u00a0will meet our FY19E. Re-iterate BUY and Target Price of SGD11.20 (0.94x FY19F P/BV \u2014 its 10-year mean).",
      "The industry is very volatile at the moment due to uncertainty over US-China trade war. This has caused a sudden shift in consumer behaviour, especially business travel and Chinese tourists. Overcapacity looms on certain routes due to this as airlines have yet to adjust their capacities.",
      "In Singapore Airlines\u2019s case, routes within the ASEAN region, as well as to China and India are impacted. Otherwise, Singapore Airlines has achieved its first growth in passenger yields since 2016, which indicates the bottom has been reached.",
      "Singapore Airlines\u2019s fuel hedge provided net savings of SGD102m in 3QFY19. For 9MFY19, it had net savings of SGD386m.",
      "Singapore Airlines has hedged 80% of its 4QFY19 fuel requirements at USD74/bbl, which is slightly lower than the current market price. This will enable Singapore Airlines to price its inventories more effectively and precisely as compared to its competitors that are mostly lightly hedged or entirely on the spot market.",
      "We like Singapore Airlines for its modest capacity growth strategy, which should enable it to manage yields relatively better than its competitors. Its fuel hedge reduces operating risk significantly and greatly safeguards positive margins going forward.",
      "Furthermore, its sub 5% dividend yield is attractive compared to other carriers and the STI.",
      "\nPassenger demand matches supply",
      "The Group was able to fill up its seats fairly well in 3QFY19, as exhibited by the record load factor of 82.8%. The keyword is active capacity management and selling promotional seats well ahead of time. Furthermore, Singapore Airlines is very clinical in adding capacity and quick to make adjustments based on passenger demand.",
      "Management indicated that the near-term outlook is pretty encouraging and expects a high level of passenger load factor. The areas that are under pressure are the short-haul and budget segment. These business segments are facing overcapacity on certain routes and this is putting pressure on yields.",
      "\nCargo still going strong, but dark clouds ahead",
      "The cargo business is performing well. The Group managed to achieve high-single-digit yield growth, albeit at flat volumes. The US-China trade war spat has created a new level of uncertainty and many cargo shippers have abandoned long-term schedules for one-time consignments. The industry still has pricing power for now as most of the tariffs imposed are not on goods shipped via air and therefore largely unaffected.",
      "However, should a new tariff encroach into high-value and time-sensitive cargos, this can quickly diminish air cargo carriers\u2019 pricing power. The situation is very volatile and nobody could put their finger on what would be the next rendition between the US-China trade war episodes.",
      "\nMaking good progress on yields",
      "The graphs below show the yield movement of the passenger and cargo businesses since FY12. We are encouraged by the performance in 3QFY19, as Singapore Airlines was able to achieve respectable yield growth despite a challenging operating environment. We believe the momentum will continue into FY20 and this should help to boost profits and cash flows.",
      "\nRisk adverse approach on fuel",
      "Singapore Airlines has hedged 80% of its 4QFY19 fuel requirements at USD74/bbl, which is slightly lower than the current market price of USD78. For FY20, it has hedged 69% of its fuel requirements at levels below current market prices. Management highlights that it will actively sought more fuel-hedging exposure should the market present itself with opportunities.",
      "Singapore Airlines has the second highest fuel-hedge coverage ratio among the Asia Pacific carriers. This is proving to be a great advantage as it has locked in the fuel price at attractive levels. This also enables Singapore Airlines to sell its tickets longer into the future as the risk profile has been significantly reduced."

      "\nSingapore Airlines (SIA SP) - 3QFY19: Earnings Beat, But Does Not Warrant A Re-rating",
      "While SIA's 3QFY19 earnings were better than expected, we still do not see that as a catalyst for upward revision.",
      "While pax yields or RASK could be maintained into the next two quarters, there is a strong likelihood that demand could falter as the global economy slows down. We already see signs of that for the cargo business.",
      "We maintain our HOLD rating, with an unchanged target price.",
      "Suggested entry level, S$9.50.",
      "\nAdmirable quarter, given headwinds and 6.9% pax capacity growth at group level.",
      "SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L, SIA)\u2019s 3QFY19 net profit came in 25% and 27% above our and street estimates respectively. The earnings beat was due to stronger-than-expected pax yields, which turned out to be flat y-o-y vs our expectation of a 1% y-o-y decline and lower than expected non-fuel cost.",
      "Group revenue grew 6.4%, underpinned by a 7.7% rise in pax flown revenue. Despite that, operating profit was weak, due to a 27% y-o-y rise in into-plane fuel cost.",
      "Operating cash flow before working capital changes was nonetheless higher by 2.6%.",
      "\nPax yields remain firm on long haul, but faces pressure on short haul regional routes.",
      "SIA singled out the US routes as having the strong load factors and favourable yields on the front end, but noted weaker pricing on the back end for the same sector. SIA also noted strong demand and yields on the direct business and premium economy only flights to Los Angeles and New York.",
      "In addition, SIA noted that for the parent airline, yields would have risen by 2% y-o-y, were it not for a stronger Singapore dollar.",
      "\nJV & associate income (-66.6%) dragged down by Vistara and Nok Scoot in 3QFY19.",
      "Virgin Australia, in which SIA has a 20% share, saw profits surging 16-fold to A$73.8m.",
      "SIA also invested S$184m in Vistara in 3QFY19 to fund the latter\u2019s capex. Total investment in the airline amounted to S$370m.",
      "\nSIA sees a general slowdown in cargo demand since Dec 18.",
      "This is consistent with an observation from WorldACD which highlighted a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d of negative volume and yields for December. SIA pointed out that cargo yields dipped 4.2% in December. We believe yields will fall further in 1Q19, drawing guidance from industry authority, Drewry which reported that rates dropped 3.5% m-o-m in January.",
      "SIA hedged 80% of jet fuel requirements for 4QFY19 at US$74/bbl vs 3QFY19\u2019s 58% at US$71/bbl. For FY20, SIA has hedged 54% of jet fuel at US$76 and another 15% at US$55/bbl",
      "\nA key positive is the fact that long haul yields are holding up.",
      "However, we are not sure to what extent the yields are a reflection of a period when consumer confidence was more buoyant. Yields typically fall as the economic cycle reverses and general cargo yields are a leading indicator of softer demand.",
      "Still, we are open to the possibility that SIA\u2019s firmer yields are due to improved product offerings and could remain firm for the next six months.",
      "\nCash flow concerns have not abated.",
      "We had previously highlighted that SIA could require additional funding.",
      "We raised our FY19 net profit forecast by 3% to reflect marginally better pax yields in 3QFY19.",
      "We maintain our target price of S$10.20, which is SOTP-based, factoring our fair value for SIA Engineering and 0.75x FY20F's book value for the remaining business.",

      "\nSingapore Airlines - Outlook For Fy20f Has Improved On Cheaper Fuel",
      "SIA\u2019s 9MFY3/19 core net profit made up 92% of our full-year expectations, which is in line as a typical 4Q is seasonally weak.",
      "Maintain HOLD due to the tough competition, with an unchanged target price of S$10.25, based on 0.9x CY19F P/BV (1 s.d. below mean since 2001).",
      "The outlook for FY20F is better, due to the correction in jet fuel prices since Oct 2018, and because the US$ is no longer likely to appreciate significantly.",
      "SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L)\u2019s 3QFY19 core net profit of S$284m was 25% lower y-o-y on the back of higher average jet fuel prices, and the depreciation of revenue currencies such as the A$, \u20ac and \u00a3, while the appreciation of the US$ pushed up operating costs.",
      "Beyond the headline numbers, however, are some interesting dynamics. SIA\u00a0mainline\u2019s operating profits were rather flat y-o-y; while cost per available seat km (CASK) growth exceeded revenue per available seat km (RASK) expansion due to fuel cost increases and possible start-up losses of the non-stop A350-900ULR flights to the US that began in Oct and Nov 2018, SIA mainline may have seen growth in some non-ticket incomes.",
      "SIA group switched to a new revenue management system in CY17 and over the past five quarters had managed to increase SIA mainline\u2019s RASK y-o-y by stimulating a large rise in demand and passenger load factor (PLF) by lowering yields, although CASK growth stole its thunder.",
      "SilkAir and Scoot\u2019s operating profits fell significantly y-o-y in 3QFY19, but again, there are interesting nuances.",
      "SilkAir, which had an over-ambitious expansion plan, saw its RASK fall y-o-y over 12 quarters to 2QFY19, but managed to engineer 1.2% growth in RASK in 3QFY19 when its capacity expansion stopped. Unfortunately, this was not sufficient to cover a 4.9% rise in CASK.",
      "Scoot\u2019s PLF fell 3.6% pts y-o-y in 3QFY19, the first in seven quarters. This may be partly due to the negative demand reaction from the hike in Changi airport tax from 1 Jul 2018, causing its RASK to drop 5.8% y-o-y vs. 8.3% rise in its CASK.",
      "The momentum for cargo demand and yield improvements have weakened as we progressed to Dec 2018, hence in 3QFY19, SIA\u2019s cargo business failed to deliver growth to its revenue per unit of available freight tonne km (AFTK) capacity for the first time in the eight quarters. Its cargo\u2019s unit profitability shrank y-o-y for the first time in 10 quarters.",
      "Refer to the PDF report attached for comparison of respective operating metrics.\u00a0",
      "Lower oil prices should benefit FY20F earnings, based on an average all-in jet fuel price assumption of US$78.5/bbl for FY19F, and US$76.5/bbl for FY20F (inclusive of hedging gains). This reflects average spot jet fuel price assumptions of US$82/bbl and US$75/bbl, respectively. However, the increasingly-apparent cyclical weakness in cargo demand may offset some of the gains from cheaper fuel prices.",
      "We have not reflected potential earnings enhancements from the transfer of 14 x 737-800 narrowbody aircraft and regional routes from SilkAir to Scoot (to be effected between Apr 2019F and Jun 2020F).",
      "\nUpside risks to our call:",
      "Lower-than-expected oil prices, depreciation of the US$ as a result of a potential pause in the US Federal Funds Rate increases, and improved group profits once the 737-800 planes are transferred from SilkAir to Scoot.",

      "Revenue grew 6.5% y-o-y to S$4.34bn mainly on growth in passenger demand with passenger yields being flat. Operating costs outpaced revenue growth at 9.1% y-o-y mainly due to a 22.2% increase in fuel costs as a result of higher average jet fuel price during the quarter. Hence, operating profit fell 14.6% y-o-y to S$387.6m.",

SIA ENGINEERING CO LTD (SGX:S59)\u2019s EBIT contribution fell by 16% y-o-y to S$16m.",

SIA\u2019s flagship passenger segment performed well by posting an improvement in passenger load factor of 1.8ppts to 83.4% while keeping passenger yield stable, enabling a decent growth in revenues for the segment. This helped to partially offset the weaker performances of Scoot and Silkair, both of which saw weaker yields during the quarter.",
      "Looking ahead, we expect SIA\u2019s 4Q19 earnings to post a y-o-y improvement on lower fuel costs as spot jet fuel prices averaged US$80/bbl while the quarter-to-date average price of spot jet fuel is US$73/bbl and the current price is US$78/bbl.",
      "Coupled with strong momentum from SIA\u2019s transformation programme to spur revenue growth, i.e. focusing on Revenue per Available Seat KM (ASK) through optimising the balance between yield and load factors, this should lead to better earnings for the carrier.",
      "We reiterate our BUY call on SIA, as we believe that lower fuel costs will lead to better earnings over the next two years. At the same time, the ongoing transformation programme could also lead to a sustained improvement in its operations and profits.",

      "A robust improvement in revenue (+S$265m) in 3Q largely offset higher fuel and non-fuel expenditure. The former was driven by growth in passenger demand (+S$245m or 7.7%), while cargo flown revenue was steady against last year (+S$3m or 0.5%), as stronger yields offset lower loads carried.",

      "\nAviation \u2013 Singapore - SIA & STE Could Surprise On The Downside; The Latter Due To One-Off Impairment Charges",
      "We expect SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L)\u00a0to report S$227m in net profit for 3QFY19, a 21% y-o-y decline on pre- SFRS 1-based numbers, and expect Singapore Airlines to be more cautious in its forward guidance.",
      "For SINGAPORE TECH ENGINEERING LTD (SGX:S63), we expect 4Q18 earnings to be hit by an impairment loss from the divestment of VT Leeboy India.",
      "For SATS LTD. (SGX:S58), we expect flat headline net profit but mid-to single-digit growth in underlying 3QFY19 net profit.",
      "SIA ENGINEERING CO LTD (SGX:S59) could be a wild card, with potential upside surprise from its engine JV.",
      "Top picks are SATS and ST Engineering.",
      "\nSIA and ST Engineering could surprise to the downside in the upcoming results, but we remain\u00a0positive on ST Engineering.",
      "We expect SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L) to report S$211m in net profit for 3QFY19, a 21% y-o-y decline on pre-SFRS1 adjustment on 3QFY18 net profit.",
      "For SINGAPORE TECH ENGINEERING LTD (SGX:S63, ST Engineering), our full-year estimate is also lower than the street\u2019s and, implicitly, we expect 4Q18 net profit of S$149m vs street expectations of S$169m. The variation is mainly due to our expectation that ST Engineering could report a S$22m disposal loss from the sale of Leeboy India (LBI). We believe that much of consensus estimates have not factored that in. Excluding that, our numbers are in line with street expectations. We also expect ST Engineering\u2019s top-line growth to show a marked improvement due to guidance on higher orderbook recognition in 4Q18.",
      "\nSIA: Likely to post uninspiring results on the back of higher fuel costs and lower pax yields.",
      "Our estimated 21% y-o-y contraction in 3QFY19 net profit is based on pre-SFRS 1 adjustment for 3QFY18. Singapore Airlines is likely to revise upwards its 3QFY18 net profit by about S$100m to factor in lower D&A and hence the y-o-y decline in 3QFY19 earnings could be significantly higher.",
      "Key factors that are expected to contribute to lower earnings are a 16% y-o-y rise in jet fuel costs, lower fuel hedging gains as well as likely weak earnings from SilkAir and Scoot.",
      "We also expect the parent airline\u2019s pax yield to decline 0.8% y-o-y in 3QFY18 but RASK to rise by 1.4% y-o-y. A 1% y-o-y change in pax yield from our base assumption is expected to lead to a 9.8% y-o-y change in net profit.",
      "\nSATS: 3QFY19 net profit likely to be flat yoy.",
      "Gateway services revenue growth and profitability were key drivers to SATS LTD. (SGX:S58)'s operating profit in 2QFY19. However, revenue growth for the segment could be affected by a decline in cargo handled, as Changi Airport\u2019s air cargo volume in tonnage fell 0.9% y-o-y during the quarter.",
      "Still, after factoring in stronger contribution from TFK, higher food solutions revenue from China and the cruise business along with q-o-q improvement in associate earnings, we expect headline net profit to be flat y-o-y but underlying net profit to rise by mid-single-digits (3QFY18 included earn-out gains of S$4.5m).",
      "\nSIA Engineering: Operating earnings likely to remain weak but net profit could show yoy growth underpinned by engine associates and JVs.",
      "We expect net profit of SIA ENGINEERING CO LTD (SGX:S59)\u00a0for 2HFY19 to rise 5.7% y-o-y. If the pace of revenue decline slows substantially and margins remain stable, these could be catalysts for re-rating, especially if improving line maintenance revenue is a key contributor.",

      "\nRemain neutral on Singapore Airlines; key datapoints to watch out for are:",
      "\nWe remain buyers on SATS; key datapoints to watch out for are:",
      "We are also encouraged by SATS\u2019 recent investments to build a new central kitchen in Tianjin, and ground handling and catering centres at Daxing in Beijing. We also expect SATS to raise its final dividend payout to S$0.13/share from S$0.12."

      "Upgrade SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L)\u00a0to BUY from HOLD and raise Target Price 14% to SGD11.20 as we raise P/B multiple to the historical avg. from 1SD below due to lower risks to growth. Our revised Target Price is based on 10-year P/BV mean of 0.94x vs. 0.82 previously.",
      "We estimate 3QFY19 (out Feb-19) core net profit of SGD316m (+14% y-o-y, +80% q-o-q). 3QFY19\u2019s overall load factor eased by 0.3ppt y-o-y and q-o-q to 76.1% and we expect yields to continue its downtrend (-1.1% y-o-y), but lower fuel price (-3% q-o-q) has more than offset this.",
      "We raise SIA's FY19-21E earnings by 33%, 37% and 17% respectively to factor in lower fuel price, better yield outlook, its latest traffic-growth plans and USD/SGD estimates.",
      "Overall traffic (passenger + cargo) in 3QFY19 grew 3.9% y-o-y. Load factor receded by 0.3ppt y-o-y to 76.1%, which is still considered high by historical comparison.",
      "We believe management\u2019s strategy to consolidate Silkair into the parent airline is a wise decision. They have done this before with merger of Tigerair into Scoot with great success. This will create clear demarcation between the premium and budget segment.",
      "We expect traffic growth momentum to slow going forward due to market maturity and based on management\u2019s latest growth plans.",
      "SIA\u00a0has hedged up to 46% of its fuel needs up to FY23 at reasonable levels (USD57-64/bbl Brent), which provides some cost stability and lowers operating risk.",
      "Our revised earnings forecasts are now above consensus. We think the market has not priced in SIA\u2019s operational resilience and the benefit of a lower fuel-price environment. Furthermore, we are optimistic its efforts to consolidate operations will yield cost reductions.",
      "Its dividend yields of > 4% are also attractive and above peer average.",
      "\nTraffic growth was healthy",
      "Passengers carried by the Group grew by 6.3% y-o-y to 9.3m in 3QFY19. This is above its long-term average of 5% growth (excluding the Tigerair acquisition y-o-y comparison), which suggests passenger traffic growth was very healthy.",
      "The growth in cargo carried shrunk marginally by 0.6% y-o-y in 3QFY19.",
      "\nLoad factor",
      "The Group passenger load factor grew by 0.7ppt y-o-y to 82.8% in 3QFY19 (Oct-Dec 2018).",
      "Cargo load factor was down by 2.3ppt y-o-y to 66.0% in 3QFY19. The cargo segment performed exceptionally well over the past three years but there has been a noticeable decline in 3QFY19\u2019s performance.",
      "\nYields close to bottoming, in our view",
      "Passenger yield has been on a persistent downtrend and it\u2019s currently hovering at 15% lower than its historical average yield of SG11.8 cents/km. Cargo yield however staged a recovery back in FY17 and is currently hovering above its historical average yield of SG31 cents/ton.km.",
      "Historical observations suggest that passenger yield tends to track cargo yield movement with a 2-3 year lag. If this trend repeats itself, it would suggest that the passenger yield downtrend is close to bottoming and could stage a recovery."

      "We expect SIA\u2019s upcoming results release on 14 Feb to be unexciting, as the headwinds experienced in 2Q continued to persist until end-CY18.",
      "Having said that, the outlook for FY20F has improved due to weaker jet fuel prices, and we upgrade our core net profit forecasts accordingly.",
      "Maintain HOLD with a slightly higher target price of S$10.25, still based on 0.9x CY19F P/BV, 1 s.d. below mean since 2001.",
      "SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L)\u00a0delivered 2QFY19 core net profit that was 40% lower y-o-y on the back of higher oil prices, and the depreciation of the A$, \u20ac, and \u00a3 where SIA is net long, and the appreciation of the US$, where SIA is net short. These factors more than offset stronger cargo earnings, and masked SIA mainline\u2019s and Scoot\u2019s successful revenue management efforts (that raised revenue per unit of ASK capacity by lowering ticket prices to stimulate an elastic demand response).",
      "During the Oct-Dec 2018 quarter, we estimate that SIA\u2019s all-in jet fuel prices (inclusive of hedging gains) averaged US$82/bbl, which was higher than the US$72/bbl average in 3QFY18 and also higher than the US$80/bbl of the immediately preceding 2QFY19.",
      "While spot oil prices had dropped sharply from early-Oct 2018, airlines\u2019 jet fuel prices generally lag by one month, so the average for 3QFY19 captured the steep rise in spot oil prices during Sep 2018. Also, the currency trends seen during 2QFY19 continued to play out during 3QFY19. As such, we expect SIA\u2019s core net profit to be weaker y-o-y.",
      "In addition, SIA\u00a0may report start-up losses for its non-stop A350-900ULR flights to Newark, Los Angeles and San Francisco, which started in Oct and Nov 2018. Initial promotional fares are likely loss-making, and the premium economy cabin saw low take-up in the initial period.",
      "Furthermore, Scoot saw its load factor drop 3.6% pts y-o-y in 3QFY19F, the first time in seven quarters, which may be partially due to the negative demand reaction from the hike in the Changi airport tax from 1 Jul 2018.",
      "Finally, the cargo business saw the volume of weight carried contract y-o-y for the first time in six quarters, with a larger drop during the month of Dec 2018, reflecting the global slowdown in GDP and trade growth and the softening of the business cycle.",
      "Lower oil prices should benefit earnings in 4QFY19F and FY20F, and we have cut our average FY19F all-in jet fuel price assumption from US$80.2/bbl to US$78.5/bbl, and for FY20F from US$83.4/bbl to US$76.5/bbl. The jet fuel price assumption changes have been reflected in our new core EPS estimates.",
      "However, we have not reflected potential earnings enhancements from the upcoming transfer of 737-800 aircraft and routes from SilkAir to Scoot, which should enhance the profitability of the group as a whole.",

      "\nAirlines and airport services",
      "Due to robust yield management strategies, SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD (SGX:C6L) mainline carrier and Scoot have seen four consecutive quarters of y-o-y increases in revenue per unit of ASK capacity (RASK), as higher load factors have more than offset yield declines. SIA\u2019s cargo operations also continue to see strong demand and yields.",
      "The SIA\u00a0group is also pursuing structural initiatives, like de-emphasising growth of SilkAir in favour of lower-cost Scoot. SIA has relaunched its direct, long-haul flights to the US, which will help boost its short-haul connections and enhance its network connectivity.",
      "Capacity expansion by the Middle East and Chinese airlines has generally slowed in recent quarters, and as these carriers do not hedge fuel, we expect them to be more rational in their pricing and capacity expansion going forward. Conversely, SIA\u2019s robust 46% fuel hedge cover until CY22F will protect the group substantially, against less-fortunate, lightly-hedged peers.",
      "Rising middle income population supported traveling patterns. We saw this in the strong operating statistics in SATS LTD. (SGX:S58)\u2019 latest 2QFY3/19 earnings with a 13.6% y-o-y increase in passengers handled and +4.6% y-o-y rise in flights handled (+4.6% y-o-y). Cruise Centre was the star performer with 113 ship calls handled (+242% y-o-y).",
      "\nLand transport",
      "Due to the optimisation and renewal of its taxi fleet in Singapore, COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LTD (SGX:C52) has seen three consecutive quarters of q-o-q increases in operating profit from the taxi business amid expansion of its fleet over the Jul-Sep period. Taxi idle rate remains at 2% and its fleet stood at 12,691 as at end-Sep; ComfortDelGro\u00a0is expecting to take delivery of up to 700 new hybrid taxis by year-end. Total taxis in Singapore saw a net increase of 115 over the Jul-Sep period, in contrast to a net decline of 2,407 private hire cars in the same period.",
      "For its public transport services, ComfortDelGro continued to see y-o-y increases in operating profit over the past six consecutive quarters amid higher ridership across all of its rail services \u2013 North East Line (NEL), Sengkang-Punggol LRT (SPLRT) and Downtown Line (DTL) \u2013 with the newer DTL\u2019s average daily ridership registering an 82.9% y-o-y increase to 472k passenger trips during the Jul-Sep 18 quarter. The Public Transport Council has also approved a 4.3% hike in rail fares that will take effect by year-end after three consecutive years of fare declines, which should translate into an increase of S$10.9m in train revenue for ComfortDelGro.",
      "\nAirlines and airport services",
      "Changi Airport raised the passenger service charge (PSC) by S$13.30 effective 1 Jul 2018, representing a 2.5% hike in SIA mainline\u2019s average fares, a 5.6% hike for SilkAir, and a 7% hike for Scoot. Long-haul flights should be immune to this, but demand for short-haul and LCC flights could be impacted, and make it more difficult for the SIA group to pass on higher jet fuel prices. We expect oil prices to rise over the next two years due to the effects of the International Maritime Organization\u2019s global sulphur cap on marine fuels that will take effect from 1 Jan 2020; this has the potential to hurt SIA\u2019s bottomline.",
      "IATA recently highlighted that growth in global air passenger demand and airfreight demand has been slowing down, commensurate with the slowdown in global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI). Also, we expect the potential losses from SIA\u2019s launch of direct ultra long-haul (ULR) flights to the US to be visible from 4QCY18F onwards, although they remain strategically critical to SIA.",
      "SATS has started to feel the pressure from trade tension as cargo volumes for emerging markets and in/out of China slowed down. Weakening currency from India and Indonesia also eroded some of its associates\u2019 profits.",
      "Our airlines analyst, Raymond Yap, is taking a more bullish view on jet fuel prices, which we assume to average US$85/bbl in CY18F, rise to US$90/bbl in CY19F, and to US$95/bbl in CY20F, driven up by US sanctions on Iranian oil exports and by the upcoming IMO 2020 implementation. This is expected to be partially offset by assumed increases in base ticket prices, but this may not fully recover the higher fuel costs. However, the outlook for SIA may be made more challenging in CY20F due to the softening global growth outlook, as indicated by the sequentially declining global Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) and the new export orders of the global PMI.",
      "For ComfortDelGro, we see robust earnings growth in FY19F (+13% y-o-y), underpinned by stronger earnings from both the taxi and public transport services segments. Notwithstanding Go-JEK entering the private-hire car (PHC) fray but under a more regulated ride-hailing space and given that Uber has exited Southeast Asia after sparking an unsustainable price war, we believe the worst is over for ComfortDelGro\u2019s taxi business. Public transport services should continue to grow, supported by a 4.3% hike in rail fares and overseas acquisitions.",
      "Declining growth in trade could also post softness in freights handled by SATS. In the longer term, alternative trade routes into/out of ASEAN (such as Vietnam) could mitigate this, but we do not expect this to take place in the next 12 months.",
      "We downgrade the overall transport sector to NEUTRAL\u00a0from Overweight, following our recent downgrade of SIA to HOLD (see report: Singapore Airlines (SIA) - Risks To Watch Out For).",
      "Our target price for SIA is at S$10.10, based on 0.9x CY19F P/BV, which is at -1 s.d. of its P/BV mean since 2001, as we do not think that investors will be motivated to bid up the share price given the prevailing tough conditions. We do believe, however, that SIA is intrinsically worth at least 1x P/BV over the long term, as the airline group continues to be profitable despite very tough competitive conditions, and continues to invest in its products, services and network that keeps it at, or near, the top of its peers in every way imaginable.",
      "ComfortDelGro is our preferred pick in the transport sector with an ADD call on the stock. Our target price of S$2.74 is based on DCF valuation (WACC: 7.4%; LTG: 2%) which implies 18x CY19F P/E. At 14x 12M forward P/E, below its 10-year historical average of 16x, its valuation appears undemanding, in our view.",
      "We have a HOLD call on SATS with a Target Price of S$5.06, based on 20x CY19F P/E (3-year mean). Re-rating catalysts could come from sizeable earnings-accretive M&As. At c.19x CY19F, the stock appears fairly traded with potential risks from further devaluation of emerging market currency and weaker-than-expected cargo handling volume as a result of trade tension."

We recall that there was significant excitement in the market in the earlier part of this year, with great expectations for new order wins especially for Sembcorp Marine (SGX:S51) (along with speculation of a possible merger), but both disappointed as we cruised through the year. This is despite crude prices continuing their upward climb till end Sep, before dropping steadily in the last two months or so.",
      "We believe a clear point of realization for some erst-while bulls came in mid Jul when Sembcorp Marine\u2019s management mentioned that the group\u2019s transformation efforts to move up the value chain has resulted in new business opportunities but they require significant time and effort in project co-development with potential customers. Such new-build EPC projects have detailed engineering and construction planning phase, which may take as long as six to 12 months before main construction activities and corresponding revenue recognition can take place.",

We upgraded our rating on the stock to BUY in early Feb this year. See recent report:\u00a0ST Engineering - Well-placed For Long Term Growth.",
      "Sembcorp Marine (SMM), in comparison, saw a roller-coaster ride in the earlier part of this year due to excitement over potential new orders and a merger talk between itself and Keppel, only to correct subsequently when nothing significant materialised. New order flows have also disappointed so far this year. Since the start of this year, our rating has been a HOLD for the stock. See recent report:\u00a0Sembcorp Marine - Not Much Of A Surprise.",
      "Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (YZJ)\u2019s stock was also volatile, falling about 43% from the beginning of this year to its trough in mid Jul, before rising by about 48% to current levels. We upgraded the stock in BUY in mid Jun, before downgrading to HOLD in early Oct. In early Nov post 3Q18 results, we upgraded the stock to BUY again.

Our rating for ComfortDelgro was upgraded to Buy in mid Feb before it was downgraded to HOLD in early Jun. See recent report:\u00a0ComfortDelGro - Monitoring The Taxi Space.",
      "As for SIA Engineering (SIAEC), it has broadly tracked the market so far this year, except for a recent fall in share price post the release of its 2QFY19 results and our rating downgrade to HOLD on 9 Nov. See recent report: SIA Engineering - Headwinds And Some Turbulence.

      "Brent crude closed at its highest level in four years in early Oct, settling at more than US$86/bbl for the first time since Oct 2014.",
      "\nOCBC and Bank of Singapore stuck to their guns",
      "Crude oil, being a highly liquid exchange traded product that is susceptible to speculative trading, tends to overshoot on the upside as well as on the downside in the near term. OCBC Treasury Research and Strategy as well as Bank of Singapore (BOS) sounded caution when it looked as if the crude market was getting overheated, arguing on the basis of fundamentals.",
      "When certain banks increased their forecasts during crude\u2019s upward march in the middle of this year (only to decrease after Oct), both OCBC and BOS stood by their forecasts ranging from US$60-70/bbl for end 2018. Indeed from early Oct onwards, both Brent and WTI crude have tumbled by about 30% since.",
      "Looking ahead, OCBC is forecasting WTI to average US$65 in 4Q19, and Brent at US$70. BOS is forecasting WTI and Brent at $60 and $65 12 months out from mid Nov 2018.",
      "\nUS \u2013 making history by exceeding 11m bbl/day for the first time",
      "According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), US crude oil production reached 11.3m bbl/day in Aug 2018 \u2013 the first time that monthly US production levels surpassed 11m bbl/day. The growth in Texas and New Mexico production since the start of 2018 surpassed EIA\u2019s previous expectations, which assumed that pipeline capacity constraints in the Permian region would dampen production growth. However, industry efficiencies in pipeline utilisation and increased trucking and tail transport in the region have allowed crude oil production to continue to grow at a higher rate than expected.",
      "Over the past 10 years, US crude oil production has increased significantly (Exhibit 5 in the PDF report attached), driven mainly by production from tight oil formations using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. EIA estimates of crude oil production from tight formations in Aug 2018 reached 6.2m bbl/day, or 55% of the national total.",
      "\nUS - now the world\u2019s top crude producer; upside supply risks remain",
      "The US crude oil production of 11.3m bbl/day in Aug was also more than the Russian Ministry of Energy\u2019s estimated Aug production of 11.2m bbl/day, making the US the leading crude oil producer in the world. The oil price decline in mid 2014 resulted in US producers reducing their costs and temporarily scaling back production. However, after crude oil prices increased in early 2016, investment and production began increasing later that year. In comparison, Russia and Saudi Arabia have maintained relatively steady crude oil production growth in recent years.",
      "Looking ahead, EIA forecasts US crude oil production to increase by 1.0m bbl/day in 2019, and we see upside supply risks which may cap the upside on oil prices.",
      "Overall, the utilisation rate of marketed rigs has continued to increase this year, and is now hovering slightly under 75%. Supply of marketed rigs has decreased slightly, while supply of the entire rig fleet has fallen to a greater degree with scrapping of older units.",
      "However, for a better idea of the outlook for our local yards, it is useful to drill down and look at the three main rig segments in turn \u2013 jack-ups, semi-submersibles and drillships.",
      "After declining significantly in 2014-2016, utilisation rates for harsh environment jack-ups in NW Europe saw stabilization in 2017 before recovering this year, such that current utilisation rates hover around 65- 70% (Exhibit 9). Utilisation has to increase more first before we can see a recovery in day rates. This has been one of the segments that Keppel Corp (SGX:BN4) and Sembcorp Marine have been focused on, and a continued recovery may herald better news for both companies. In comparison, the shallow water jack-ups in the SE Asia region (Exhibit 8 in the PDF report attached) did not see a recovery unlike the NW Europe harsh environment jack-ups.",
      "For ultra-deepwater semi-submersibles (Exhibit 10 in the PDF report attached), the utilization rate remains low at around 35%, and average day rates remain low as well. Unlike other rig types, this segment has not seen an uptick in utilisation rates.\u00a0",
      "As for the drillship segment (Exhibit 11 in the PDF report attached), utilisation levels seem to have found a bottom in 2017, and there has been an uptick in 2018. The recovery is likely to be a very gradual one, which is not surprising given that the deep-water space is usually lagging in the recovery process.\u00a0",
      "The transport sector is very much affected by oil prices as well, due to fuel costs. However, the extent varies as well. ComfortDelgro\u2019s business segments include public transport operations, and fare adjustments are also tied to fuel costs as well, to either contain the upside or compensate ComfortDelgro when fuel costs swing.\u00a0",
      "In comparison, fuel costs affect airlines to a greater extent, but it also depends on the amount of hedges that the airline uses. In 1HFY19, fuel costs (post hedging) accounted for 30% of SIA\u2019s total costs. For 2HFY19, SIA has hedged 58% of its fuel requirements in MOPS (jet fuel) at a weighted average price of US$71, against the current MOPS price of US$87. For FY20, 52% is hedged with 17% at US$79 on average for jet fuel) and 35% at US$56 on average for Brent.\u00a0",
      "\nOutlook for transport-related names\u00a0",
      "Oil prices aside, we expect ComfortDelgro (SGX:C52)\u2019s growth to be driven by overseas acquisitions, supported by stable operating cash flows from public transport operations in Singapore. So far this year, the group has invested about S$450m in overseas acquisitions, mainly in Australia. As for its taxi operations, the market is likely to focus on the actions that Go-Jek would take in its entry to Singapore. Should an aggressive pricing strategy be pursued, sentiment on the stock may be affected. We estimate that the Singapore taxi business accounts for about 20-25% of operating income for the group.\u00a0",
      "For SIA (SGX:C6L), passenger load factors should remain strong on robust passenger growth, but passenger yields may be capped by intense competition from rival airlines. For 2HFY19, earnings should improve on weaker oil prices. Over the longer term, this is a capital intensive business and significant capital expenditure is expected, and we forecast an increase in net gearing for the group.\u00a0",
      "\nSIA Engineering",
      "SIA Engineering (SGX:S59), in which SIA owns a 77.7% stake, faces some issues in the meantime. Aircraft are spending a longer time in the hangars than before, meaning missed opportunities to undertake maintenance work for other aircraft. The number of checks that can be undertaken is constrained by hangar capacity, so there may be a limit to growth unless the group comes up with creative solutions or new income streams.\u00a0",
      "\nSATS Ltd",
      "SATS (SGX:S58) has been steadily increasing its dividends over the years since FY13, backed by an average 6-7% earnings growth per year. We believe there is ample cushion for dividends to be sustained, and sufficient room for investments as well.",
      "Post our downgrade on 9 Nov and the release of its 2QFY19 results, the share price of SATS Ltd has dropped by 9.1% compared to the STI\u2019s 0.2% fall over the same period, based on the closing price on 28 Nov. Recall that results were in line with our expectations, with 1H18 net profit accounting for 51% of our full year figure.",
      "We had downgraded our rating for SATS due to the limited upside potential post share price appreciation, but now with the recent correction, value is emerging again. We are now upgrading to BUY with a slightly lower Fair Value estimate of S$5.34 (prev S$5.39).\u00a0",
      "\nGradual recovery in 2019; continued flow of orders needed\u00a0",
      "Looking ahead in 2019, we expect the offshore oil and gas sector to continue its gradual recovery, underpinned by cost deflation across the industry and lower break evens. Orders are still mainly expected from the non-drilling segment as recovery in the drilling market will still take time. However, should there be significant contract wins in 2019 for Keppel Corp (SGX:BN4) and Sembcorp Marine, we see chances for trading opportunities especially for the latter.",
      "A sustained recovery, however, will only ensue with a continued flow of contract wins, which will drive a re-rating of related stocks in the sector.\u00a0",
      "\nPreferred picks \u2013 STE and SIA\u00a0",
      "Among the Singapore Industrials space, we prefer ST Engineering (STE) [Rating:\u00a0BUY; Fair Value: S$3.95] with its earnings resilience, backed by a stable and diversified order book across industries (aerospace, electronics, land systems and marine), and Singapore Airlines\u00a0(SIA) [Rating:\u00a0BUY; Fair Value: S$10.71] due to its low valuations and a softer oil price environment which should lend near-term support to earnings.\u00a0"

      "the ongoing rise in the US$ in which most of SIA\u2019s costs are denominated in,",
      "the depreciation of SIA\u2019s major revenue currencies such as the A$, \u20ac and \u00a3,",
      "the global business cycle slowdown that may impact future demand for premium seats and for airfreight, and finally,",
      "the start-up losses from the ULR flights.",
      "We have cut our FY88-88F core net profit forecasts by 88-88%, as we raise our S$:US$8 assumption from S$8.88 to S$8.88 for all forecast years, and as we raise our spot jet fuel price assumption from US$88/bbl in FY88-88F to US$88/bbl for FY88F and US$88/bbl for FY88F. This is partially offset by an assumed increase in base ticket prices, but this is not expected to fully recover the higher fuel costs.",
      "Our target price of S$88.88 is based on 8.8x CY88F P/BV, which is 8 standard deviation below the P/BV mean since 8888. Our previous target price of S$88.88 was based on 8.88x CY88F P/BV, which is approximately the P/BV mean. We have used a lower P/BV multiple to establish our 8-year forward target price for SIA, as we do not think that investors will be motivated to bid up the share price with the prevailing tough conditions.",
      "We do believe, however, that SIA is intrinsically worth at least 8x P/BV over the long term, as the airline group continues to be profitable despite very tough competitive conditions, and continues to invest in its product, service and network that keeps it at, or near, the top of its peers in every way imaginable."

      "\nSingapore Airlines - 2QFY19 Challenges In The Price",
      "We estimate a 2QFY19 (out 13 Nov) core net profit of SGD118m (-38% y-o-y, -16% q-o-q). We think yield attrition and higher jet fuel prices will weigh on its bottom line. Otherwise, the company has done a good job of raising overall loads by 1.7ppts y-o-y to 73.3%, a record since 2010.",
      "We raise FY19-21E earnings by 3.9-5.5% to factor in higher load factors, its latest traffic-growth plans and new USD/SGD estimates.",
      "Our Target Price climbs to SGD9.80, still at FY20E P/BV of 0.82x, 1SD below its 10-year mean.",
      "SIA\u2019s share price has declined by 13% in the last quarter. As we believe this has priced in its near-term challenges, upgrade to HOLD.",
      "Overall traffic (passenger + cargo) in 2QFY19 grew 2.9% y-o-y. Load factor went up by 1.7% y-o-y to 73.3%. This was the group\u2019s highest load factor since 2010.",
      "Changi Airport has slapped a SGD13.30 or 39% increase in passenger tariffs beginning Jul 2018.",
      "We also notice that published ticket fares are on the low side and factor in an 8% yield decline for 2QFY19 (8% decline in 1QFY19).",
      "The fuel market is exceptionally volatile due to the US-China trade war and US embargo on Iran. As SIA has hedged 47% of its FY19 requirements at USD65/bbl (Brent), it should be better positioned than the other airlines.",
      "SIA\u2019s 2QFY19 will be saddled with big losses from its 20% associate, Virgin Australia (VAH AU, Not Rated), which reported a net loss of AUD603.5m in its 2H18 results. SIA\u2019s share of losses could be SGD50-60m in 2QFY19 but we deem this non-core as the bulk is accounting in nature.",
      "We also believe we have adequately factored in its near-term risks.",
      "\nTraffic growth healthy",
      "Passengers carried by the group grew 8.4% y-o-y to 9.1m in 2QFY19. This was above its long-term average of 5% growth (excluding its Tigerair acquisition), which suggests healthy passenger traffic growth.",
      "Cargo growth was equally healthy at 2.9% y-o-y in 2QFY19.",
      "\nLoad factor",
      "Group passenger load factor soared by 3.1ppts y-o-y to 84.9% in 2QFY19. We think yields were dropped in order to promote loads.",
      "Cargo load factor was slightly down by 0.5ppt y-o-y to 63.5%. The air cargo industry has been performing very well in the past 2.5 years, driven by growth in the electronics segment and Internet retail sales.",
      "SIA has been trading range-bound, close to 1SD below its P/BV mean, in the past two years. We believe 1SD below mean is an apt valuation, given that its short-term outlook is clouded by volatile fuel prices, higher Changi Airport charges and huge one-off losses from Virgin Australia.",
      "Using a one-year forward P/BV of 0.82x, we derive a Target Price of SGD9.80 after our earnings revisions.",
      "SIA\u2019s share price has declined by 13% in the last three months. As we believe this has priced in its near-term challenges, upgrade to HOLD from SELL."

      "\nPertinent points from analyst briefing\u00a0",
      "\nSwing Factors\u00a0",
      "SIA\u2019s 4QFY16 and FY16 results were way below ours and consensus expectations.\u00a0",
      "Yields were much weaker and the cargo business continued to lose money?. However, to its credit, SIA has achieved credible unit cost reduction through efficiency gains.\u00a0",
      "We lower our FY17-18 forecasts by -3.2% and -6.7%, respectively to incorporate its latest fuel hedges and lower yields, and introduce a FY19 forecast.\u00a0",
      "Maintain HOLD with a 2.5% lower TP of SGD11.5 (from SGD11.8), pegged to an unchanged 1x FY17 P/BV, which is SIA\u2019s historical mean.\u00a0",
      "Central to SIA\u2019s quandary are the three giant Middle Eastern carriers, which have made commanding inroads into the premium segment.\u00a0",
      "Secondly, all the mainline Chinese carriers have splurged capacity on trans-Pacific flights and this has hurt SIA\u2019s market share, as well as marginalize its cargo segment. These pressures are unlikely to abate anytime soon, in our view.\u00a0",
      "The bright sparks were Silkair and Scoot, which delivered strong YoY growth. Tigerair also breakeven in FY16.\u00a0",
      "We forecast overall yields (passenger + cargo) to erode by a further 3.7% in FY17 as the long-haul sector continues to face stiff competition. However, we forecast unit cost to decline by 4.2% YoY in FY17 as SIA enjoys the benefit of the lower fuel price as its expensive fuel hedges expire.\u00a0",
      "SIA will also derive some cost savings on the planned removal of two older Boeing B747-4F, one Boeing B777-3 and four Airbus A330-3, and replace them with ultra-modern and efficient new aircraft models.\u00a0",
      "SIA announced a DPS of SGD0.35 (+106% YoY), bringing the full-year total to SGD0.45 (+105% YoY).\u00a0",
      "Its 65% payout ratio is among the highest in the industry and the current dividend yield of 4.0% will appeal to certain investors and provide downside support to the share price.",
      "Management expects an extremely challenging operating environment for the\nyear.\u00a0",
      "The Middle Eastern and also Chinese carriers are growing at a fast pace and\nhurting the yields on the premium segment.\u00a0",
      "The budget segment is more resilient\nand is growing strongly.\u00a0",
      "The core growth markets for SIA are India and China. Management is optimistic\nregarding buoyant demand in these two countries, driven by a strong domestic\neconomy, a resurgence of the middle income class population, and a rapidly\nglobalizing economy.\u00a0",
      "We agree with management\u2019s views that India and China\nare indeed the new \u2018big market\u2019 for a long time to come.\u00a0",
      "There will be a net addition of ten aircraft in FY17, with the addition of 17\naircraft and the removal of seven older aircraft from the fleet. This includes the\ndecommissioning of two freighter aircraft, its first reduction since 2011.\u00a0",
      "SIA will\ninduct the ultra-modern Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 aircraft models, whilst\nremoving the older Boeing 777-3, Airbus A330-3, and Boeing 747-4F. This fleet\nrejuvenation should help reduce unit cost and possibly appeal to more\ncustomers.\u00a0",
      "We are positive with management\u2019s action to rejuvenate its fleet, as SIA has the\noldest average fleet age of any state carrier in the ASEAN region. But we are\nconcerned with the high number of net fleet additions in FY17. For the past five\nyears, SIA has typically only grown its fleet by 3-5 aircraft p.a.. Therefore, we\nthink there is a high probability that SIA will return five leased Airbus A380\naircraft that are due to expire to the lessor in 2017.\u00a0",
      "There were plenty of\nquestions regarding the A380 aircraft status, but management was adamant that\nit has yet to reach such a decision.\u00a0",
      "There has been wide speculation in the press that Tigerair and Scoot will be\nmerged soon, which management has not denied nor confirmed.\u00a0",
      "We believe it\nwill eventually happen, and the real question is when? In our opinion, it would be\nmutually beneficial longer-term, assuming they can streamline operations and\nreduce the overlapping staff functions. Should the merger story occur, we think\nit could potentially improve the sentiment on the counter.\u00a0",
      "Yield is the most important earnings driver, but the trend\nhas been negative for the past three years.\u00a0",
      "Low fuel price is providing a significant cost reduction\nand boost to the bottom line.\u00a0",
      "Strong demand and supply scarcity in the region should\ndrive up loads and yields in the medium term.\u00a0",
      "Tigerair acquisition is costly and the market is keen to\nsee how it extracts value to benefit the Group.\u00a0",
      "An increase in the value of the SGD against destination\ncountries and the USD will have an adverse effect on\nyields.\u00a0",
      "Increased competitive pressure from the Middle Eastern\ncarriers and also from regional peers who have upgraded\ntheir fleets and services.\u00a0"

      "SIA\u2019s full-year FY16 core net profit came in 6% below expectations, implying a 4Q that underperformed 22%, mainly due to more-than-expected yield declines.\u00a0",
      "The group increased its profits in FY16 vs. FY15, as lower oil prices more than offset yield declines, but the incremental fuel price drop will be smaller in FY17.\u00a0",
      "Juxtapose that against accelerating yield declines, and the group may not deliver EPS growth this year, which is why we have cut FY17-18 core EPS by 29-34%.\u00a0",
      "We think it is time to lock in SIA\u2019s outperformance, hence we downgrade from Add to Hold; our target is lowered to S$12.42, still based on P/BV of 1.1x (avg since 2001).\u00a0",
      "The SIA group grew its full-year core earnings by 61%, as the lagged effect of lower oil prices finally flowed down to the bottom line with the gradual expiry of expensive legacy fuel hedges.\u00a0",
      "The passenger airlines businesses (mainline SIA, SilkAir, Scoot and Tigerair) all saw improved profits for that reason. SilkAir and Scoot also had the benefit of new 737 and 787 planes, respectively, which helped them to improve operating efficiencies.\u00a0",
      "The 4Q yield declines accelerated across the board, and could extend into FY17.\u00a0",
      "The continuing decline of mainline SIA\u2019s monthly yields is of special concern, due to weakness in long-haul and premium travel demand.\u00a0",
      "The cargo business was especially dire, with SIA Cargo delivering its largest loss in almost three years, due to weak demand and excess capacity, causing large yield declines.\u00a0",
      "Scoot was the only airline within the group that did not see its yields decline, despite growing its capacity 41% yoy in 2HFY16. Instead, it reported its second consecutive quarterly profit in 4Q16, which was even higher than the immediately preceding 3Q, and surprisingly equalled that of SilkAir in just a few short years of its existence. This was achieved on the back of strong demand which lifted loads to 85% (the highest in the SIA group), the growing maturity of its route network, and its new and efficient 787s.\u00a0",
      "SilkAir delivered much stronger earnings than the year before, with a modest yield drop that was more than offset by a larger unit cost decline. The latter was achieved on the back of the new 737 fleet, capacity expansion and lower oil prices.\u00a0",
      "Once concern is that SilkAir\u2019s 4Q16 yields fell at a faster pace of 8.2% yoy, vs. 3Q16\u2019s 3.5% decline.\u00a0",
      "The group\u2019s all-in price of jet fuel fell US$33/bbl yoy in FY16 (to US$84), but we forecast it to drop \u2018only\u2019 US$13/bbl in FY17 (to US$71), inclusive of hedging losses. This is based on a spot price assumption of US$60 and SIA\u2019s existing 31% hedge book at an average strike price of US$81. The smaller drop is of concern if yield declines accelerate.\u00a0",
      "The cargo business could see larger losses in FY17, while mainline SIA\u2019s profits could shrink slightly on yield pressures, offset by higher earnings at SilkAir and Scoot.\u00a0",
      "The net result could be flattish group profits that may not inspire share price performance.\u00a0"

      "While traffic grew modestly at 1%, capacity grew by a faster 7%, leading to a 3.8ppt decline in load factor in March.\u00a0",

      "More recently, SIA increased its stake in VAH from 22.9% to 23.1% through a series of equity swaps, done at a premium to the open market price. While the increase in stake is only 0.2%, we believe the key inference one should draw from these transactions is SIA showing its commitment in its interest in VAH.\u00a0",
      "Apart from Europe, Australasia is another key market of SIA, and a majority stake in VAH may help SIA compete more effectively with the existing dominant player \u2013 Qantas. Therefore, we do not rule out the possibility of SIA buying over Air NZ\u2019s stake in VAH, but such action will trigger a takeover bid (based on ASX rules).\u00a0",

This could be due to a low base in the aftermath of the Indonesia AirAsia QZ8501 crash in Dec 14. However, this is not the case for Chinese visitors which saw double-digit growth for 10 consecutive months.\u00a0",
      "Going forward, we expect Changi Airport\u2019s pax throughput to remain buoyant as low air fares and increased airline capacity to regional destinations such as Malaysia, Thailand and Australia, lead to spillover tourist arrivals as well as transit traffic.\u00a0",

      "With 81% and 79% market share of Changi Airport\u2019s pax throughput and flight movements in 3QFY16 respectively, SATS will be a direct beneficiary of the surge in both pax throughput and flight movements. Both SATS\u2019 unit meals and unit services have high correlations of 78% and 72% to the number of pax handled and flights handled at Changi respectively.\u00a0",
      "Assuming Changi airport\u2019s pax throughput rises 9% in 1Q16, SATS unit services could rise 11-14% in 4QFY16, which could in turn boost gateway services revenue by 6-7%. This is higher than our implied estimate of a 3% growth in gateway services.\u00a0",

      "We met with SIA\u2019s management. SIA\u2019s strong 3QFY16 results and qoq improvement in pax yields underscore the impact of lower fuel hedges and the resilience of front-end yields.\u00a0",

      "The decline in revenue on the back of lower yields was less than the decline in opex (mainly fuel cost) and this led to the incremental operating margin. A weaker Singapore dollar however led to net S$65m negative impact on net profit.\u00a0",
      "Going into FY17, earnings are likely to improve further as:\u00a0\n\n fuel hedges unwind,\u00a0\n yields stabilise as more premium economy seats are launched, and\u00a0\n SilkAir and Scoot\u2019s profitability improves with more fuel efficient aircraft.\u00a0\n\n",

      "Despite weakness in the oil and gas sector and job attritions in the financial sector, SIA\u2019s corporate travel market held its own. In addition, SIA indicated that demand for premium economy seats were especially strong on London, Sydney and Auckland routes with loads of 80% and higher, but cautioned that it was weak on Chinese and Indian routes.\u00a0",
      "SIA also indicated that forward bookings were higher as compared with a year ago, for both business and economy class, but was stronger for back end. This holds scope for stable yields in 4QFY16. Forward bookings, as at 3QFY16, rose 6.6% yoy.\u00a0",
      "SIA indicated Scoot\u2019s capacity is likely to rise by 20-30% over the next few years and envisions strong demand and improved operating efficiency on new aircraft.\u00a0",
      "We believe that Scoot will become increasingly material to SIA group\u2019s earnings.\u00a0",
      "On the cargo front, SIA lamented that yields were exceptionally weak across most sectors due to overcapacity in the region.\u00a0",
      "We have thus lowered our cargo yield assumptions for FY16 and FY17 by 2% and 3% respectively.\u00a0",

      "Also, SIA\u2019s enhanced codeshare partnership with Lufthansa has not yet secured regulatory approval but following which, both carriers will operate revenue sharing on Singapore - Zurich, Singapore - Dusseldorf, Singapore - Munich and Singapore - Frankfurt. SIA will then be able to tap on to corporate travel in the region and provide further connection to South West Pacific.\u00a0",

The greatest load factor improvement was in long-haul routes, to West Asia, Africa, Southwest Pacific, Europe and the US. SIA attributed this to selective capacity adjustments and promotional activities.\u00a0",
      "Pax loads for Oct 15 and Nov 15 averaged 79%, a 3ppt yoy increase.\u00a0",

SIA also continued to rationalise capacity, with 1.8% reductions ytd.\u00a0",
      "The load factor improvement to Europe (Oct: +0.3ppt vs Sep: -2.1ppt) suggests that SIA could have gained market share on some routes, but likely at the expense of lower yields. Even so, SIA\u2019s exposure to Europe is substantial at 29% and hence the higher loads are operationally critical for the carrier.\u00a0",

      "Traffic rose 25.5%, outpacing capacity growth, which led to improved load factors (+2.8ppt). Comparatively, SilkAir\u2019s load factor fell as its aggressive capacity expansion of 11% yoy was not completely absorbed by market demand.\u00a0",
      "The higher loads for parent airline and subsidiaries are positive given fierce competition and depressed yields. Assuming pax loads and yields approximate that of 2QFY16, SIA should have been profitable in October.\u00a0",

      "Singapore Airlines\u2019 (SIA) 2QFY16 core PATMI missed our expectations as it formed only 21.1% of our FY16 forecasts.\u00a0",
      "Excluding Tigerair, 2QFY16 revenue declined 5.8% YoY to S$3.7b, mainly due to a 7.0% decline in revenue from the parent airline as a result of a 4.6% decline in passenger yields.\u00a0",
      "Cargo yield also fell 9.4% despite higher freight carriage. If not for the 15.2% YoY decline in 2QFY16 fuel costs, total operating expenses would have been higher, driven mainly by higher aircraft lease rentals, costs to retrofit cabins for premium economy product, and aircraft maintenance and overhaul costs.\u00a0",
      "Consequently, 2QFY16 reported PATMI jumped 135.0% to S$213.6m, but stripping out one-off dividend income of S$91.1m, 2QFY16 core PATMI came in at S$122.5m.\u00a0",
      "For 1HFY16, core PATMI rose 161.6% YoY to S$213.7m, which formed only 36.8% of our FY16 forecasts.\u00a0",
      "In our view, privatising Tigerair will benefit SIA over a longer-term horizon as it gives management flexibility and ability to accelerate the process to unlock synergies within the group to achieve cost savings and maximisation of revenue.\u00a0",
      "Within SIA\u2019s portfolio, we believe there are much more in terms of route rationalization that can be done between Scoot and Tigerair to capture interlining traffic. However, given current competitive landscape of the airline industry within the region, SIA\u2019s traditional strategy of pursuing growth through its full service parent airline will not help.\u00a0",
      "We believe pressure on passenger yields on its parent airline is likely to remain with the continued capacity expansion of the Gulf carriers, especially for the Europe routes.\u00a0",
      "For 2HFY16, SIA is 50.7% hedged at an averaged hedged price of US$93/barrel. Management guided that the percentage hedged and average hedged price will decline with time as the more expensive hedges continue to expire.\u00a0",

      "From a financial perspective, we see little merit to the offer, given that SIA:\u00a0\n\n already has effective control of Tigerair, and\u00a0\n has about S$12.8b of capital commitments on its own and its cash holdings is S$4.9b, thus effectively an inefficient utilisation of resources.\u00a0\n\n",

      "Pax yield fell 4.6% yoy, within expectations. Yields declined the most in August, and showed sequential improvement in September. The crux of the issue is to what extent yields can stabilise in the coming months. In 2HFY15, pax yields were relatively firm. On balance, we believe yields will decline by at least 5% in 2HFY16.\u00a0",
      "Scoot\u2019s losses had declined by 90% as overall operating costs declined sharply from greater fuel efficiency. SilkAir meanwhile benefitted from lower unit costs and higher yields.\u00a0",
      "While we believe some of the aggressive price discounts are likely to end, given stability in fuel prices, we believe SIA\u2019s ticket prices are still at a substantial premium to competitors. If economic environment continues to weaken, SIA\u2019s ability to maintain yields will be further impacted even if fuel prices stabilise.\u00a0",
      "2QFY16\u2019s improved earnings were also a reflection of higher load factors. We are unsure as to what extent SIA will be able to improve its utilisation. August\u2019s load factor for example was flat yoy, compared to July\u2019s and August\u2019s 2.7ppt increase.\u00a0",
      "SIA recognised S$569m in fuel hedging losses in 1HFY16. In 2H15, we believe this quantum will drop as existing fuel hedges are lower. For instance, SIA has hedged 50.7% of its 2HFY16 fuel requirements at US$93/bbl vs 55.4% hedged at US$104/bbl. Thus, if fuel prices remain unchanged from 2QFY16\u2019s average, fuel hedging losses should be lowered by US$11/bbl and lead to an almost S$300m drop in fuel hedging losses hoh.\u00a0",

      "Maintain MARKET WEIGHT.\u00a0",
      "The parent airline is expected to report an operating profit of S$180.8m, driven by higher pax load and lower fuel costs but offset partially by lower pax yield. We have estimated a 4.6% yoy decline in pax yields and essentially assumed the pace of decline has continued from that in May-Jun 15. Every 0.1 S cent change from our base assumption will impact the parent airline\u2019s operating profit and group net profit by S$25m and S$20m respectively.\u00a0",
      "Meanwhile, existing fuel hedges are expected to lead to more than S$200m fuel hedging losses for the period.\u00a0",
      "Overall, we expect SIA to declare an unchanged interim dividend of 5 cents/share.\u00a0",
      "In the previous down cycle, yields only bottomed out two quarters after jet fuel prices bottomed out. A similar scenario could pan out over the next two quarters.\u00a0",
      "SIAEC could see higher airframe revenue due to \u201cC\u201d checks on SIA\u2019s A380 aircraft. We are however doubtful of a meaningful improvement in engine maintenance revenue, which declined by almost 42% in the previous quarter.\u00a0",
      "We expect a 1 S cent decline in interim dividend to 5 S cents/share.\u00a0",
      "Higher unit services and unit meals are expected to lead to a small revenue growth, while lower raw material costs and licensing fees are expected to boost operating profit. On the revenue front, SATS had resumed handling Jetstar Asia\u2019s gateway operations from Jul 15, which we believe accounted for most of the increase in unit services.\u00a0",
      "On the cost front, raw material costs are likely to have declined in line with the lower commodity prices, while rebates announced by Changi Airport is likely to lead to lower opex.\u00a0",
      "We estimate its interim dividend is likely to remain unchanged at 5 S cents/share.\u00a0",
      "TFK secured a S$325m long-term contract from Delta Airlines, which should start contributing in 2HFY16. We reckon TFK was operating close to breakeven level in previous quarters and that the Delta contract will boost operating profit.\u00a0",
      "The extent of yield decline and quantum of fuel hedges will be the key focus areas. If the decline in yield is less than expected due to better pricing or a weaker Singapore dollar, it will have positive ramifications for the remaining quarters.\u00a0",
      "SIAEC will be hosting an analyst briefing. We will seek greater clarity on the trend for third-party maintenance and engine checks. SIAEC cut interim and final dividends in FY15.\u00a0",
      "ASP for gateway services and inflight catering will be key focus areas. If yields stabilise, particularly for gateway services, that will hold scope for higher margins. We would also seek greater clarity on the increase in unit services and meals. Associate income typically accounts for 15-20% of pre-tax profit. A qoq decline could suggest that associates were impacted by lower cargo handled or translation losses.\u00a0",

      "Load factor is impressive, but this came at the expense of lower yields as competitors cut prices to gain market share and loads. SIA has to reciprocate by dropping its fares but is saddled with expensive fuel hedges: 55% of its fuel in 2QFY16 had been fixed at USD104/bbl vs an average market price of USD66/bbl.\u00a0",
      "We cut FY16-18 EPS by 11.4%/8.5%/10.5% after filtering revenue generated from aircraft slot trades which we deem non-recurring.\u00a0",

      "Group - parent airline, Silk Air, Scoot and Tigerair - passenger load factor\nimproved 1.9ppts YoY to 83.1% in 2QFY16. This was its best quarterly load\nfactor since it started publishing the information. Traffic growth was flat\nas ASK shrank 0.1% YoY. From this, we infer that this was the second year\nthat the group\u2019s capacity has not grown. Management says it will inject\ncapacity growth in CY2016, supported by incoming fleet deployment.\u00a0",
      "The cargo market was less buoyant as its load factor shrank 1.7ppts YoY to\n60.3%. Load factor has been languishing at its 5-year low mark since Apr\n2015. Cargo capacity grew 2.6% YoY in 2QFY16. Management pointed to a\nweak air-freight industry that is suffering from overcapacity.",
      "Almost all the geographical segments exhibited an exceptional Jul-Aug\n2015 before easing in Sep 2015. We are not concerned by the drop in Sep\n2015 load factors as it coincided with flight frequency addition. The\nstandouts are the Australasia and European sectors, which are achieving\nabove 90% load factors. This momentum should continue into 2HFY16 and\ndeliver even better YoY comparisons as 2HFY15 was saddled by specific\nchallenges on the Southeast and North Asian routes.\u00a0",
      "Firstly, we filter the SGD110m compensation received in 1QFY16 for the\nrelease of seven aircraft delivery slots meant for FY18-19 as we deem this\nas non-recurring income \u2015 this information was only revealed during the\n1QFY16 analyst briefing.\nWe use management\u2019s latest guidance on capacity deployment, which will\nshrink marginally.\u00a0",
      "Overall yields have been tweaked lower to reflect\ncurrent industry trends. Our fuel-price assumptions have taken into\naccount SIA\u2019s latest fuel hedges. Based on these assumptions, we forecast\na core net PATAMI of SGD650.3m (+314% YoY). This is 11.4% lower than our\nprevious estimate of SGD734.3m.\u00a0",
      "The SGD has weakened against the USD\nand this has caused many USD-denominated costs to rise in SGD terms.\u00a0",
      "Again we use management\u2019s latest guidance on capacity growth and use\nour latest house USD/SGD forex rate. We taper down our yield assumption\nto reflect the current weak yield environment. Our fuel-price assumptions\nhave taken into account SIA\u2019s latest fuel hedges. Based on these\nassumptions, we forecast a core net PATAMI of SGD808.1m (+24.3% YoY).\nThis is 8.5% lower than our previous estimate of SGD828.1m.\u00a0",
      "We use management\u2019s latest guidance on fleet deployment to ascertain\ncapacity growth. We expect the high number of aircraft deployment to\naccelerate traffic growth to 5.0%. We assume an average jet fuel price of\nUSD100/bbl, and this will be adjusted as necessary. Based on these\nassumptions, we forecast a core net PATAMI of SGD879.8m (+8.9% YoY).\nThis is 10.5% lower than our previous estimate of SGD983.3m.",

      "Our revised TP is still pegged\nto 1x FY17 P/BV, which is close to its long-term mean of 0.98x. This should\nbe a good floor-price indicator for the airline as the company will produce\nhealthy earnings and strong balance sheet.",

      "SIA plans to re-launch the world\u2019s longest non-stop flight from Singapore to\nNew York, and Singapore to Los Angeles as well as other points in the US by\n2018. SIA will utilize the latest generation Airbus A350-900 ultra-long-haul\n(ULH) aircraft that is capable of flying up to 8,700nm.\nSIA previously had daily services to New York and Los Angeles, which were\nexceptionally popular among customers but it was discontinued in 2013 as\nit was unfeasible due to high fuel prices. SIA is sanguine that the new\ngeneration A350-900 ULH has superior cost economics and ensures\nprofitable operations.\u00a0",
      "We are neutral on this announcement as it is many\nyears away and have no financial implication in the short term.\u00a0",
      "Scoot will operate the Singapore to Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) services from 1\nMay 2016, effectively taking the route over from SIA.

Moreover, the\nroute caters specifically to religious pilgrims whom sole focus is for lower\ncost of travel rather than premium services.\u00a0",
      "This is a wise decision by management to right-fit the product profile to\npassenger demand. However, there is brand-equity erosion on the part of\nSAI as this route is a major void in the airline\u2019s ambition to become a\nglobally connected player. Jeddah is a key aviation destination with over\n70 airlines servicing the route and direct global connectivity to more than\n200 destinations.\u00a0",
      "All things considered, we believe the commercial decision by management\nto replace SIA flight with Scoot is the best trade off.\u00a0",
      "Scoot and Tigerair (56%-owned subsidiary; Not Rated) will expand their cooperation\nand jointly manage the Singapore to Guangzhou (China) route.\nBoth airlines will operate twice-daily services, and this is envisaged to\nbetter match capacity to demand.\u00a0",
      "This tie-up reinforces our view that Tigerair will eventually be taken\nprivate by the Group. We believe there will be further co-operation and\ntie-ups as it is inevitable to behave as part of the Group. Therefore, it\nwould be much easier on the Group to privatise Tigerair to absolve itself\nfrom making countless regulatory announcements and due considerations.\u00a0"

      "Despite flat performance for September, overall pax loads for 2QFY16 have improved, supported by both capacity reductions and traffic growth.\u00a0",
      "Parent airline SIA is expected to be in the black for the quarter, unless pax yields decline by more than 9% (1QFY15 -2%). SIA is expected to release its interim results on 5 Nov 15 and we will provide an earnings preview shortly.\u00a0",
      "Maintain HOLD. Target price: S$10.70. Entry price: S$9.60.\u00a0",
      "SIA\u2019s 2QFY16 load factors improved 1.8ppt; pace of improvement tapers off in Sep 15. The improvement was mainly aided by capacity reductions (-1.6%). Overall, 2QFY16\u2019s pax traffic was flat yoy, with September reversing the preceding months\u2019 upward trend. This lacklustre traffic growth comes despite promotional activities and the summer travel demand.\u00a0",
      "Pax loads to key markets Europe and US reversed from two consecutive months of gains to a decline in September. The 2.1ppt and 1.4ppt decline in loads to Europe and the US in Sep 15 could be due to recent capacity additions by Qatar at Changi.\u00a0",
      "Improved load factor likely to lead SIA into black in 2QFY16. In the previous period, SIA\u2019s parent operations was S$2m in the red, excluding S$110m in slot compensation. In the current period, SIA\u2019s pax load factor is 7.4ppt higher qoq. Thus, unless SIA\u2019s pax yield declines by more than 9% qoq, the parent airline is likely to be profitable in the current quarter.\u00a0",
      "Cargo traffic improved in Sep 15 with stronger loads to the South West Pacific market (+9.0%), but expected to continue to post a loss in 2QFY16. Cargo loads improved to South West Pacific, Asia and Africa, despite a decline to the Europe and US markets. The stronger loads are likely to be IT-related shipments, such as iPhones and electronic gadgets. However, we reckon the improvement comes on the back of reduced cargo yields. With cargo load factors still 0.8ppt lower than in 1QFY16 (61.1%), we expect cargo operations to continue to be in the red.\u00a0",
      "2Q is a seasonally stronger period compared with 1Q and thus improved profitability should not come as a surprise. Still, we expect yields to continue to decline yoy and qoq for 2QFY16 due to promotional activities and changing macro landscape. As of Sep 15, SIA has guided that \u201cpromotional activities will continue in relevant markets\u201d.\u00a0",
      "Premium traffic is an integral part of SIA\u2019s business, accounting for more than one-third of revenue historically. We believe that front-end ticket pricing would have been lowered for 2QFY16, in view of cyclical weakness in the financial and O&G sectors.\u00a0",
      "The flights would commence in 2018 with the more fuel efficient A350-900ULR. SIA previously operated flights to the US on A340s that were too costly, exiting in late-13. We view this as a strategic move to: a) tap on the North American long-haul market which has fewer competitors and no Gulf presence, and b) lower the risk of customers switching to other carriers that operate services to the US.\u00a0",
      "There is no change to our FY16 net profit estimates.\u00a0",
      "Maintain HOLD and S$10.70 target price.\u00a0",

      "\nWhat You Should Do\u00a0",
      "Predictably, SIA\u2019s share price weakened after its 1Q results indicated that yields and loads were under pressure.\u00a0",
      "But with the share price trading at close to S$10.60, which is at its support of 0.9x P/BV, or 1 s.d. below the average P/BV mean since 2001 of 1.1x, the downside is limited, and this could now be a good opportunity to accumulate.\u00a0",
      "Our target is set at the P/BV mean and near-term upside catalysts include a lower price of jet fuel from 2H onwards, while medium-term catalysts include product retrofits and introduction of premium economy from Aug which should improve the yield mix, and fleet replacements that help lower unit costs.\u00a0",
      "We maintain Add, but lower our FY16-18 forecasts 11-16% and reduce our target price (from S$12.97 to S$12.89) accordingly.\u00a0",
      "At its analyst meeting, SIA highlighted that its monthly yields were showing pressures on a yoy as well as on a month-on-month basis (Figure 2), primarily on services to the US and Europe, reflecting aggressive capacity expansion by competitors.\u00a0",
      "Passenger load factors also saw softness; despite SIA mainline reducing ASK capacity by 2.4% yoy during 1QFY15, RPK demand fell 4.2% yoy.\u00a0",
      "Business class demand fell by more than economy class demand, leading to a negative mix effect which also weakened average yields.\u00a0",
      "Services within ASEAN, and to Australia, had been less affected by yield pressures this time around, and SilkAir\u2019s yields still managed a small 0.8% yoy increase while increasing capacity 7.2%.\u00a0",
      "In contrast to SIA mainline, SilkAir\u2019s PLF rose 0.6% pts yoy.\u00a0",
      "",
      "The weakness in yields look likely to continue for the rest of the year and our previous SIA mainline yield forecast of 11.09 Scts/RPK for FY16 is now revised down to 10.98 Scts, down 2% from 11.20 Scts in FY15, and lower than even the 11.10 Scts achieved during FY14.\u00a0",
      "There is no need to be overly pessimistic on SIA, especially at the current share price.\u00a0",
      "Weak long-haul yields are a result of not just competition, but also the weak trade volume growth this year which tends to influence the level of long-haul business-related travel.\u00a0",
      "We forecast a rebound in trade volumes next year that should help boost air travel demand. Also, fuel prices will finally decline more significantly for SIA in 2H to US$80/bbl, from US$94 in 1H, which could lift hoh earnings by an incremental S$365m.\u00a0",
      "Not to mention that the 2H is the seasonal summer peak to Europe as well as the year-end school and Christmas holidays in Singapore."

      "SIA fell into a core net loss of S$25m during 1QFY16, its first quarterly loss since 2009, underperforming our full-year profit forecast of S$721m, on yield weakness at SIA mainline and SIA Cargo due to strong competition to US and Europe and weak global trade growth.\u00a0",
      "We maintain Add as we expect SIA to post better results in the 2H after it uses up most of its expensive legacy fuel hedges in the 1H.\u00a0",
      "Medium-term catalysts include the introduction of premium economy from August, and cabin retrofits on the 777-300ERs that should improve the yield mix, and fleet replacements that should lower unit operating costs.\u00a0",
      "We cut our EPS forecasts 8-26% on lower yield assumptions, and cut our target price to S$12.97 (from S$13.05), still based on 1.1x CY15 P/BV (average since 2001).\u00a0",
      "SIA reported a net profit of S$91m, but this included S$110m in compensation from Airbus for agreeing to give up seven slots out of its 70-strong A350 order, without which SIA would have suffered a core net loss of S$25m.\u00a0",
      "This is SIA\u2019s first quarterly core loss since 2009, and the unpleasant surprise was due to a 1.8% yoy yield decline at SIA mainline after two consecutive quarters of yield improvement, and an acceleration of the cargo yield decline to 7.6%.\u00a0",
      "Weak trade volumes to Europe and the US likely hit passenger and cargo demand and exacerbated the competition and oversupply.\u00a0",
      "While SilkAir did better than last year, and SIA Cargo and Scoot narrowed their losses, these did not compensate sufficiently for the drop in SIA mainline\u2019s earnings.\u00a0",
      "While revenue metrics will likely remain under pressure for the rest of the year, we highlight that SIA did not enjoy the full benefits of the low oil price during the 1Q, as 58.5% was hedged at US$110/bbl of jet.\u00a0",
      "As a result, we estimate that SIA\u2019s post-hedging fuel price fell only 20% yoy to US$96/bbl during 1Q16, against a 37.4% yoy drop in the spot price of jet to US$73/bbl.\u00a0",
      "For the 2Q, SIA will remain highly hedged at 55.4% of consumption at US$104/bbl, but for 2H15, SIA will only be 32% hedged at around the same price.\u00a0",
      "Buying opportunity could emerge SIA\u2019s share price could see pressure today, but anything below S$10.60 would be a good entry point, as SIA usually finds support at 0.9x P/BV, or 1 s.d. below the average P/BV mean since 2001 of 1.1x."

      "Fuel cost savings to be more substantial from 2H FY16 onwards, which should earnings recovery.\u00a0",
      "SIA hedged 55.4% of its fuel requirements for 2Q16 at US$104/bbl, and c. 45% of its fuel requirements for the full year at less than US$106/bbl, implying that fuel cost savings will be more substantial for SIA from 3Q onwards.\u00a0",
      "We project SIA\u2019s earnings to more than double to S$763m in FY16F and grow further to S$1,105m in FY17F.\u00a0",
      "Earnings risk is on the upside if jet fuel stays below US$90/bbl for a sustained period.\u00a0",
      "We have assumed an average jet fuel price of US$90/bbl for SIA in FY16 and FY17, compared to the current price of c.US$75/bbl.\u00a0",
      "If fuel prices do not move up further, there should be further upside to our earnings estimates.\u00a0",
      "Each US$1 saving on average jet fuel price boosts SIA\u2019s earnings, ceteris paribus, by S$50m per annum.\u00a0",
      "Our S$12.80 target price is based on 1.1x FY16 P/BV, pegged to its historical mean and reflects SIA\u2019s improved earnings outlook.\u00a0",
      "With net cash of c. S$3.40 per share, we see current valuation of 0.9x FY16 P/BV as an attractive entry level for investors.\u00a0",
      "Vulnerable to demand shocks and price competition SIA is susceptible to demand shocks such as economic outlook or pandemics e.g. if the MERS situation hits Singapore like SARS did back in 2003.\u00a0",
      "However, share price rebounded quickly even during SARS once the situation was under control. Intense competition could put pressure on yields, which would impact the carrier\u2019s profitability."

      "SIA\u2019s May pax load factor to Europe was the lowest in six years and came amid increased competition from Qatar Airways, which began operating the Airbus A350 aircraft out of Singapore on 11 May.\u00a0",
      "By August, Qatar Airway\u2019s total capacity out of Singapore will rise 67% and pose an even greater challenge to SIA\u2019s biggest market - Europe.\u00a0",
      "We thus cut our FY16 net profit forecast by 24% and lower target price to S$11.60.\u00a0",
      "Maintain HOLD. Suggested entry level is S$10.30, which is -1SD on P/B.\u00a0",
      "Singapore Airlines\u2019 (SIA) overall pax load factor fell 1.3ppt in 2MFY16 (Mar-Apr 15), with pax load factor to Europe declining by an average of 5.6ppt.\u00a0",
      "Europe accounts for 28% of SIA\u2019s (parent airline) capacity and is also a key market for business travels. The decline in Europe\u2019s load factor could be due to Qatar Airways\u2019 introduction of the new Airbus A350 aircraft on 11 May. Qatar Airways is also increasing its flight frequency to Doha to thrice weekly, from twice weekly, by August.\u00a0",
      "According to the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, this will result in a 67% rise in Qatar Airways\u2019 capacity out of Singapore.\u00a0",
      "For SIA, this will lead to increased competition on Europe and North America routes as the Middle East is an important connecting point to these regions.\u00a0",
      "We lower SIA\u2019s pax load factor assumption for FY16 from 78.9% to 77.7%.\u00a0",
      "We estimate every 1ppt change in load factor will shave about S$150m at operating level for FY16.\u00a0",
      "Current promotional fares to five European cities are at least 30% cheaper than SIA\u2019s. Qatar Airway\u2019s ultimate goal appears to be a slice of SIA\u2019s high-yielding business class as the increased capacity will add 448 weekly business-class seats to Europe, via Doha.\u00a0",
      "We estimate the increase in business-class capacity will approximate 11-14% of SIA\u2019s business-class capacity to Europe.\u00a0",
      "Both load factors and yields are likely to ease in the coming months.\u00a0",
      "We believe the market is aware of the risk of the lower yields but may not be aware of the cause.\u00a0",
      "In addition, there is a real risk of yields deteriorating in the coming months. This is likely to be reflected in SIA\u2019s 1QFY16 results in August.\u00a0",
      "Much of the optimism we had for SIA stemmed from six consecutive months of yield improvement from Sep 14 as well as the likely cost efficiencies from new deliveries.\u00a0",
      "However, Qatar Airway\u2019s latest move has raised the ante for SIA.\u00a0",
      "We cut our FY16 net profit forecast by 24%. Our net profit estimate is now 5% lower than consensus. Aside from yields and load factor, the primary swing factor will be fuel prices but the impact will not be significant as SIA has already hedged 55% of fuel requirements for the year.\u00a0",
      "We also lower our dividend estimate for FY16 from 50 cents to 45 cents.\u00a0",
      "Maintain HOLD but lower our target price from S$12.40 to S$11.60.\u00a0",
      "We also lower our fair value P/B multiple for SIA\u2019s core business from 0.9x to 0.85x. Core ROE ex- SIAEC is estimated at 5.1% due in part to its net cash of S$3.6b.\u00a0",
      "Suggested entry level is S$10.30, which is -1SD on P/B.\u00a0",
      "The stock is likely to trade between -1SD and 0.9x P/B. No catalyst aside from the said trading range."
